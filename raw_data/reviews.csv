ChIJoToG_fTMHkcRvnEOTBVeaVw,Gerald Tomyn,en,en,5,3 months ago,"This hotel is a welcome sight when staying in Warsaw. The rooms are big and comfortable. Rooms are air conditioned also. The shower is big and the water is hot. The breakfast is very good. Service is efficient.

One small complaint about the shower: there is no door, so the water gets out onto the floor of the bathroom. Also no shelf inside the shower itself so nowhere to put things.

Overall this is the best hotel I've stayed at in Poland.",1720940721,False
ChIJoToG_fTMHkcRvnEOTBVeaVw,Richard Wilson,en,en,5,a month ago,"I spent two nights here with my partner. The room that we were allocated was massive, with a separate living area, bedroom, bathroom/toilet, and another separate toilet. The beds were comfortable, and although there was no air-conditioning, the room temperature could be easily varied by opening the various windows in a slanted position.

Our room rate was very reasonable and included breakfast, which had a wide variety of cooked and cold dishes.

The hotel itself is well positioned in relation to public transport and the old town. I only had two minor niggles, the first being the shower, which sat over a bathtub with a curtain. It was impossible to stand up and shower because of the positioning of the head. Second, there was a large amount of roadwork activity outside, and the workmen started before 6 a.m.

Despite these niggles, I would still highly recommend this hotel for its value for money and location.",1727428127,False

I stayed for three nights, in a single room, on a business trip.

Everything was old: furniture, carpets, towels, sheets. The towels and sheets were clean, but the rooms and hallway were not so.

My windows were on the back side, towards the old and very noisy heating/cooling engine.

The bad was very small. Inevitably, the mattress was old and uncomfortable.

The breakfast was poor. Despite the relative variety, the products looked and felt like the cheapest option was selected.

While visiting my nephew and his family in Poland, we stopped at their favorite bistro - Bordo for lunch.

My nephew enjoy the focaccia club sandwich and side order fries and my great niece loved her Alfredo fettuccine. The portion are plentiful so come with an appetite or be prepared to bring some food home.

We enjoyed the patio because it was a perfect day to sit and relax outside.  However, there is plenty of sitting inside dining with charming decor.

The chili chicken is a really big portion that was unexpected but it was good and samosas are samosas however the winner was the gobi 65. Cauliflower never tasted so good!

Great food quality and great taste. Low prices on all dishes. Great value for the money.

A very nice local Indian retaurant with great food and service. I wanted to change the pace from the European foods and did not have Indian in such a long time. I searched out this local place and found this hidden gem. Not only was the food very deleicious, it was far far far too much for us. But we enjoyed it all. If you want very good Indian at reasonable prices, run here as soon as you can while you are in Warsaw.

It doesn't matter what time a customer checks in. If the hotel is available to be booked, it means the hotel should be in safe living conditions. The owner has a failed logic.

Our stay at Campanile Warszawa Centrum Hotel was far from satisfactory. Unfortunately, we encountered several issues that made our experience uncomfortable and disappointing.

Firstly, the room was quite average with poor ventilation and no air conditioning, making it stuffy and difficult to relax.

The lack of proper ventilation in the bathroom only added to the discomfort.

To make matters worse, we were not provided with basic amenities like room slippers. When we requested them, we were asked to pay extra, which was both surprising and frustrating. Additionally, the bedding was not properly cleaned, which is something we expect from any reputable hotel.

Lastly, the breakfast was very underwhelming. For 45 PLN per person, we expected more variety and quality, but what we got was barely satisfactory—a basic spread that didn't justify the price.

The area is safe and close to local and regional transit.

One of the highlights of my stay was the incredible breakfast buffet. With a wide variety of delicious options, from freshly baked pastries to savory hot dishes, there was something to satisfy every palate. The quality and freshness of the food were top-notch, making it the perfect way to start the day.

The staff at the Radisson Blu Sobieski were incredibly attentive and friendly. They went out of their way to ensure that my stay was as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. From the moment I arrived, I felt welcome and valued.

While the rooms are on the smaller side, they are impeccably clean and well-maintained. The modern decor and comfortable furnishings create a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Despite their size, the rooms have everything you need for a relaxing stay.

Our stay at Campanile Warszawa Centrum Hotel was far from satisfactory. Unfortunately, we encountered several issues that made our experience uncomfortable and disappointing.

Firstly, the room was quite average with poor ventilation and no air conditioning, making it stuffy and difficult to relax. The mattresses were extremely uncomfortable, made from low-quality springs, which left me with back pain throughout the stay. The lack of proper ventilation in the bathroom only added to the discomfort.

To make matters worse, we were not provided with basic amenities like room slippers. When we requested them, we were asked to pay extra, which was both surprising and frustrating. Additionally, the bedding was not properly cleaned, which is something we expect from any reputable hotel.

Lastly, the breakfast was very underwhelming. For 45 PLN per person, we expected more variety and quality, but what we got was barely satisfactory—a basic spread that didn't justify the price.

Our stay at Campanile Warszawa Centrum Hotel was far from satisfactory. Unfortunately, we encountered several issues that made our experience uncomfortable and disappointing.

Firstly, the room was quite average with poor ventilation and no air conditioning, making it stuffy and difficult to relax.

The lack of proper ventilation in the bathroom only added to the discomfort.

To make matters worse, we were not provided with basic amenities like room slippers. When we requested them, we were asked to pay extra, which was both surprising and frustrating. Additionally, the bedding was not properly cleaned, which is something we expect from any reputable hotel.

Lastly, the breakfast was very underwhelming. For 45 PLN per person, we expected more variety and quality, but what we got was barely satisfactory—a basic spread that didn't justify the price.

The lack of proper ventilation in the bathroom only added to the discomfort.

To make matters worse, we were not provided with basic amenities like room slippers. When we requested them, we were asked to pay extra, which was both surprising and frustrating. Additionally, the bedding was not properly cleaned, which is something we expect from any reputable hotel.

Lastly, the breakfast was very underwhelming. For 45 PLN per person, we expected more variety and quality, but what we got was barely satisfactory—a basic spread that didn't justify the price.

Kathmandu will surprise you with its original menu and reasonable prices. You can choose what you want if you prefer Nepalese cuisine - main dish, soup, desserts... and a huge portion! Curry, naan, thali and fish dishes are spicy and delicious.

The restaurant also had to substitute feta for tofu, since they had run out of the former.
The design is very original and makes for a nice atmosphere but the music does not follow the flow... (it’s “rocky-metal”).
Given the spicyness of our food we opted for Pina Coladas which were VERYYYY good, but our joy was cut short when we learnt they had run out of milk and were unable to make a second serving.

The restaurant also had to substitute feta for tofu, since they had run out of the former.
The design is very original and makes for a nice atmosphere but the music does not follow the flow... (it’s “rocky-metal”).
Given the spicyness of our food we opted for Pina Coladas which were VERYYYY good, but our joy was cut short when we learnt they had run out of milk and were unable to make a second serving.
In the end - since we cried ;-) - the bartender served us another round made on cream.

The design is very original and makes for a nice atmosphere but the music does not follow the flow... (it’s “rocky-metal”).
Given the spicyness of our food we opted for Pina Coladas which were VERYYYY good, but our joy was cut short when we learnt they had run out of milk and were unable to make a second serving.

The restaurant also had to substitute feta for tofu, since they had run out of the former.
The design is very original and makes for a nice atmosphere but the music does not follow the flow... (it’s “rocky-metal”).
Given the spicyness of our food we opted for Pina Coladas which were VERYYYY good, but our joy was cut short when we learnt they had run out of milk and were unable to make a second serving.

The restaurant also had to substitute feta for tofu, since they had run out of the former.
The design is very original and makes for a nice atmosphere but the music does not follow the flow... (it’s “rocky-metal”).
Given the spicyness of our food we opted for Pina Coladas which were VERYYYY good, but our joy was cut short when we learnt they had run out of milk and were unable to make a second serving.

However, after staying in a genuine 5-star property in Warsaw (the Hotel Verte), this hotel was quite a let-down.

Our double bed was 2 twins pushed together. Each single mattress was thin (6 inches?) without box springs. It was about a 5 on the 10 scale of comfort...overly firm, and strangely unyielding when one turns over. And instead of a single large duvet spanning the entire bed, we were given two duvets and two spreads, one for each half of the bed. Weird.

The bathroom is small, cramped, and lacks any usable surface area as originally designed. To make some, the hotel installed short lengths of walnut-stained 2x6"" planks above the sink and the toilet. I hit my head twice on the one above the toilet, drawing blood the second time.

Huge, heavy drapes ""grace"" the windows and spill onto the floor in large, dense puddles. The drapes show their age and need to be refreshed, the antique atmosphere of the hotel notwithstanding.  In fact much of the fabric decor...the bedspreads, the decorative pillow shams, the area rugs...is old and worn.

The staff at the front desk try to be helpful but are remarkably ignorant about sites, restaurants, transportation, etc. When one asks tourist-type questions, they go to the same internet sources you or I would go to. Fortunately an excellent Tourist Information Center is right across the street.

Electrical outlets are few and inconveniently located. No USB connections.

The TV is very, very old. Hint: if you're trying to connect a computer, look for what appears to be a single HDMI port. On the TV's source screen, use the ""Blu-Ray"" option. Really!

- The hotel's location was ideal, right next to the old town and within walking distance of major sights. There were also plenty of great restaurants nearby, offering a mix of Polish and international cuisine.
- The atmosphere was charming, with a lot of attention to small details. The inner courtyard looked lovely, though it was too chilly during our stay to fully enjoy it.
- We stayed in a studio on the first floor (two connected rooms), which was clean, spacious enough, and had comfortable beds. The decor was a bit old-school, but it worked. The bathroom was standard, but the heated towel rail was a nice touch.

What didn’t go well:

- The room’s location on the first floor, right by the street, turned out to be a huge problem. Construction work started every day at 6:30 a.m., waking our whole family :( . My father, who was in a room on the other side of the hotel, didn’t hear a thing, so it seems we just had bad luck with our room. But we weren’t warned about the noise at check-in, and when we raised it with reception, they simply said there was nothing they could do. While it wasn’t the fault of the hotel’s reception staff, they could have handled it better by not renting out rooms on that side during such noisy periods. Paying €350 a night for a room you can’t even sleep in until 7. felt really unfair, and it soured the whole experience.

- Breakfast was another disappointment. Reviews suggested there might be more variety and better quality (maybe summer time?), but during our visit, the “hot” dishes (scrambled eggs and sausages) were always cold, and some of the cold dishes were too warm. The fruits and vegetables, stored at the wrong temperatures, dried out quickly. Rather than trying to offer a lot of mediocre options, I think a small boutique hotel like this would do better focusing on a few high-quality items.

In the end, while the hotel had plenty of potential with its great atmosphere and location, the noise and lack of sleep made the experience really frustrating. It’s hard to enjoy a €350/night stay when you’re woken up by construction every morning.",1729263118,False

It was one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. It was the most unprofessional hotel I ever had the misfortune to stay in.
We arrived at 1100pm with 3 kids, 1 sick, after a very long day.  We notified the hotel that we would arrive late.
When we checked in to the 2 rooms we booked, we only had 4 beds, while we are 5 and booked for 5. The person at the reception said he doesn't have a solution. We told him that unless he expects one of us to sleep in the lobby, we need  a solution. He said he doesn't know where the folded beds are... we again explained that he must  find a solution since we booked and paid for 5 people! From that moment, he started running around the hotel, trying to call housekeeping or other staff. He then found a bed that we couldn't  fit in the room! My husband had to move heavy furniture out of the room at midnight while 2 of my kids were already sleeping.

However, after staying in a genuine 5-star property in Warsaw (the Hotel Verte), this hotel was quite a let-down.

Our double bed was 2 twins pushed together. Each single mattress was thin (6 inches?) without box springs. It was about a 5 on the 10 scale of comfort...overly firm, and strangely unyielding when one turns over. And instead of a single large duvet spanning the entire bed, we were given two duvets and two spreads, one for each half of the bed. Weird.

The bathroom is small, cramped, and lacks any usable surface area as originally designed. To make some, the hotel installed short lengths of walnut-stained 2x6"" planks above the sink and the toilet. I hit my head twice on the one above the toilet, drawing blood the second time.

Huge, heavy drapes ""grace"" the windows and spill onto the floor in large, dense puddles. The drapes show their age and need to be refreshed, the antique atmosphere of the hotel notwithstanding.  In fact much of the fabric decor...the bedspreads, the decorative pillow shams, the area rugs...is old and worn.

The staff at the front desk try to be helpful but are remarkably ignorant about sites, restaurants, transportation, etc. When one asks tourist-type questions, they go to the same internet sources you or I would go to. Fortunately an excellent Tourist Information Center is right across the street.

Electrical outlets are few and inconveniently located. No USB connections.

The TV is very, very old. Hint: if you're trying to connect a computer, look for what appears to be a single HDMI port. On the TV's source screen, use the ""Blu-Ray"" option. Really!

ChIJT3QdLw9bFkcRaBMk1SnDYiA,Samuel Tervaskanto,en,en,2,a week ago,"Spent three nights exploring beautiful Krakow with my kids, and while the city was fantastic, the hotel experience was a big letdown.

What went well:

- The hotel's location was ideal, right next to the old town and within walking distance of major sights. There were also plenty of great restaurants nearby, offering a mix of Polish and international cuisine.
- The atmosphere was charming, with a lot of attention to small details. The inner courtyard looked lovely, though it was too chilly during our stay to fully enjoy it.
- We stayed in a studio on the first floor (two connected rooms), which was clean, spacious enough, and had comfortable beds. The decor was a bit old-school, but it worked. The bathroom was standard, but the heated towel rail was a nice touch.

What didn’t go well:

- The room’s location on the first floor, right by the street, turned out to be a huge problem. Construction work started every day at 6:30 a.m., waking our whole family :( . My father, who was in a room on the other side of the hotel, didn’t hear a thing, so it seems we just had bad luck with our room. But we weren’t warned about the noise at check-in, and when we raised it with reception, they simply said there was nothing they could do. While it wasn’t the fault of the hotel’s reception staff, they could have handled it better by not renting out rooms on that side during such noisy periods. Paying €350 a night for a room you can’t even sleep in until 7. felt really unfair, and it soured the whole experience.

- Breakfast was another disappointment. Reviews suggested there might be more variety and better quality (maybe summer time?), but during our visit, the “hot” dishes (scrambled eggs and sausages) were always cold, and some of the cold dishes were too warm. The fruits and vegetables, stored at the wrong temperatures, dried out quickly. Rather than trying to offer a lot of mediocre options, I think a small boutique hotel like this would do better focusing on a few high-quality items.

In the end, while the hotel had plenty of potential with its great atmosphere and location, the noise and lack of sleep made the experience really frustrating. It’s hard to enjoy a €350/night stay when you’re woken up by construction every morning.",1729263118,False

Throughout our 4-night stay, the shower gel was empty from the beginning and remained that way until we checked out. Housekeeping services were abysmal; they only made the bed and changed the towels. They didn't bother cleaning anything else, leaving hair and dirt all over the room.

Upon checking out, we spoke to the manager, and her response was “This mess could have happened a couple of hours after your check-in” meaning she was accusing us of making this mess although our complaint was directly addressed after we checked in with proof of pictures. Her responses were absolutely unprofessional. This level of unprofessionalism and disregard for customer service is unacceptable.

However, after staying in a genuine 5-star property in Warsaw (the Hotel Verte), this hotel was quite a let-down.

Our double bed was 2 twins pushed together. Each single mattress was thin (6 inches?) without box springs. It was about a 5 on the 10 scale of comfort...overly firm, and strangely unyielding when one turns over. And instead of a single large duvet spanning the entire bed, we were given two duvets and two spreads, one for each half of the bed. Weird.

The bathroom is small, cramped, and lacks any usable surface area as originally designed. To make some, the hotel installed short lengths of walnut-stained 2x6"" planks above the sink and the toilet. I hit my head twice on the one above the toilet, drawing blood the second time.

Huge, heavy drapes ""grace"" the windows and spill onto the floor in large, dense puddles. The drapes show their age and need to be refreshed, the antique atmosphere of the hotel notwithstanding.  In fact much of the fabric decor...the bedspreads, the decorative pillow shams, the area rugs...is old and worn.

The staff at the front desk try to be helpful but are remarkably ignorant about sites, restaurants, transportation, etc. When one asks tourist-type questions, they go to the same internet sources you or I would go to. Fortunately an excellent Tourist Information Center is right across the street.

Electrical outlets are few and inconveniently located. No USB connections.

The TV is very, very old. Hint: if you're trying to connect a computer, look for what appears to be a single HDMI port. On the TV's source screen, use the ""Blu-Ray"" option. Really!

ChIJT3QdLw9bFkcRaBMk1SnDYiA,Samuel Tervaskanto,en,en,2,a week ago,"Spent three nights exploring beautiful Krakow with my kids, and while the city was fantastic, the hotel experience was a big letdown.

What went well:

- The hotel's location was ideal, right next to the old town and within walking distance of major sights. There were also plenty of great restaurants nearby, offering a mix of Polish and international cuisine.
- The atmosphere was charming, with a lot of attention to small details. The inner courtyard looked lovely, though it was too chilly during our stay to fully enjoy it.
- We stayed in a studio on the first floor (two connected rooms), which was clean, spacious enough, and had comfortable beds. The decor was a bit old-school, but it worked. The bathroom was standard, but the heated towel rail was a nice touch.

What didn’t go well:

- The room’s location on the first floor, right by the street, turned out to be a huge problem. Construction work started every day at 6:30 a.m., waking our whole family :( . My father, who was in a room on the other side of the hotel, didn’t hear a thing, so it seems we just had bad luck with our room. But we weren’t warned about the noise at check-in, and when we raised it with reception, they simply said there was nothing they could do. While it wasn’t the fault of the hotel’s reception staff, they could have handled it better by not renting out rooms on that side during such noisy periods. Paying €350 a night for a room you can’t even sleep in until 7. felt really unfair, and it soured the whole experience.

- Breakfast was another disappointment. Reviews suggested there might be more variety and better quality (maybe summer time?), but during our visit, the “hot” dishes (scrambled eggs and sausages) were always cold, and some of the cold dishes were too warm. The fruits and vegetables, stored at the wrong temperatures, dried out quickly. Rather than trying to offer a lot of mediocre options, I think a small boutique hotel like this would do better focusing on a few high-quality items.

In the end, while the hotel had plenty of potential with its great atmosphere and location, the noise and lack of sleep made the experience really frustrating. It’s hard to enjoy a €350/night stay when you’re woken up by construction every morning.",1729263118,False

However, after staying in a genuine 5-star property in Warsaw (the Hotel Verte), this hotel was quite a let-down.

Our double bed was 2 twins pushed together. Each single mattress was thin (6 inches?) without box springs. It was about a 5 on the 10 scale of comfort...overly firm, and strangely unyielding when one turns over. And instead of a single large duvet spanning the entire bed, we were given two duvets and two spreads, one for each half of the bed. Weird.

The bathroom is small, cramped, and lacks any usable surface area as originally designed. To make some, the hotel installed short lengths of walnut-stained 2x6"" planks above the sink and the toilet. I hit my head twice on the one above the toilet, drawing blood the second time.

Huge, heavy drapes ""grace"" the windows and spill onto the floor in large, dense puddles. The drapes show their age and need to be refreshed, the antique atmosphere of the hotel notwithstanding.  In fact much of the fabric decor...the bedspreads, the decorative pillow shams, the area rugs...is old and worn.

ChIJT3QdLw9bFkcRaBMk1SnDYiA,Samuel Tervaskanto,en,en,2,a week ago,"Spent three nights exploring beautiful Krakow with my kids, and while the city was fantastic, the hotel experience was a big letdown.

What went well:

- The hotel's location was ideal, right next to the old town and within walking distance of major sights. There were also plenty of great restaurants nearby, offering a mix of Polish and international cuisine.
- The atmosphere was charming, with a lot of attention to small details. The inner courtyard looked lovely, though it was too chilly during our stay to fully enjoy it.
- We stayed in a studio on the first floor (two connected rooms), which was clean, spacious enough, and had comfortable beds. The decor was a bit old-school, but it worked. The bathroom was standard, but the heated towel rail was a nice touch.

What didn’t go well:

- The room’s location on the first floor, right by the street, turned out to be a huge problem. Construction work started every day at 6:30 a.m., waking our whole family :( . My father, who was in a room on the other side of the hotel, didn’t hear a thing, so it seems we just had bad luck with our room. But we weren’t warned about the noise at check-in, and when we raised it with reception, they simply said there was nothing they could do. While it wasn’t the fault of the hotel’s reception staff, they could have handled it better by not renting out rooms on that side during such noisy periods. Paying €350 a night for a room you can’t even sleep in until 7. felt really unfair, and it soured the whole experience.

- Breakfast was another disappointment. Reviews suggested there might be more variety and better quality (maybe summer time?), but during our visit, the “hot” dishes (scrambled eggs and sausages) were always cold, and some of the cold dishes were too warm. The fruits and vegetables, stored at the wrong temperatures, dried out quickly. Rather than trying to offer a lot of mediocre options, I think a small boutique hotel like this would do better focusing on a few high-quality items.

In the end, while the hotel had plenty of potential with its great atmosphere and location, the noise and lack of sleep made the experience really frustrating. It’s hard to enjoy a €350/night stay when you’re woken up by construction every morning.",1729263118,False

However, after staying in a genuine 5-star property in Warsaw (the Hotel Verte), this hotel was quite a let-down.

Our double bed was 2 twins pushed together. Each single mattress was thin (6 inches?) without box springs. It was about a 5 on the 10 scale of comfort...overly firm, and strangely unyielding when one turns over. And instead of a single large duvet spanning the entire bed, we were given two duvets and two spreads, one for each half of the bed. Weird.

The bathroom is small, cramped, and lacks any usable surface area as originally designed. To make some, the hotel installed short lengths of walnut-stained 2x6"" planks above the sink and the toilet. I hit my head twice on the one above the toilet, drawing blood the second time.

Huge, heavy drapes ""grace"" the windows and spill onto the floor in large, dense puddles. The drapes show their age and need to be refreshed, the antique atmosphere of the hotel notwithstanding.  In fact much of the fabric decor...the bedspreads, the decorative pillow shams, the area rugs...is old and worn.

The staff at the front desk try to be helpful but are remarkably ignorant about sites, restaurants, transportation, etc. When one asks tourist-type questions, they go to the same internet sources you or I would go to. Fortunately an excellent Tourist Information Center is right across the street.

Electrical outlets are few and inconveniently located. No USB connections.

The TV is very, very old. Hint: if you're trying to connect a computer, look for what appears to be a single HDMI port. On the TV's source screen, use the ""Blu-Ray"" option. Really!

ChIJT3QdLw9bFkcRaBMk1SnDYiA,Samuel Tervaskanto,en,en,2,a week ago,"Spent three nights exploring beautiful Krakow with my kids, and while the city was fantastic, the hotel experience was a big letdown.

What went well:

- The hotel's location was ideal, right next to the old town and within walking distance of major sights. There were also plenty of great restaurants nearby, offering a mix of Polish and international cuisine.
- The atmosphere was charming, with a lot of attention to small details. The inner courtyard looked lovely, though it was too chilly during our stay to fully enjoy it.
- We stayed in a studio on the first floor (two connected rooms), which was clean, spacious enough, and had comfortable beds. The decor was a bit old-school, but it worked. The bathroom was standard, but the heated towel rail was a nice touch.

What didn’t go well:

- The room’s location on the first floor, right by the street, turned out to be a huge problem. Construction work started every day at 6:30 a.m., waking our whole family :( . My father, who was in a room on the other side of the hotel, didn’t hear a thing, so it seems we just had bad luck with our room. But we weren’t warned about the noise at check-in, and when we raised it with reception, they simply said there was nothing they could do. While it wasn’t the fault of the hotel’s reception staff, they could have handled it better by not renting out rooms on that side during such noisy periods. Paying €350 a night for a room you can’t even sleep in until 7. felt really unfair, and it soured the whole experience.

- Breakfast was another disappointment. Reviews suggested there might be more variety and better quality (maybe summer time?), but during our visit, the “hot” dishes (scrambled eggs and sausages) were always cold, and some of the cold dishes were too warm. The fruits and vegetables, stored at the wrong temperatures, dried out quickly. Rather than trying to offer a lot of mediocre options, I think a small boutique hotel like this would do better focusing on a few high-quality items.

In the end, while the hotel had plenty of potential with its great atmosphere and location, the noise and lack of sleep made the experience really frustrating. It’s hard to enjoy a €350/night stay when you’re woken up by construction every morning.",1729263118,False

We told him that unless he expects one of us to sleep in the lobby, we need  a solution. He said he doesn't know where the folded beds are... we again explained that he must  find a solution since we booked and paid for 5 people! From that moment, he started running around the hotel, trying to call housekeeping or other staff. He then found a bed that we couldn't  fit in the room!

The staff's attitude was nothing short of disrespectful. It felt as though they had no regard for the guests' comfort and were disinterested in providing any assistance. It's essential for any establishment in the hospitality industry to treat guests with respect and courtesy, but sadly, this was not the case here.

Their language and tone were far from what you'd expect when you're paying for a service. Instead of making guests feel welcome, they spoke in a manner that left me feeling undervalued and disrespected. It was as if they considered me a mere inconvenience rather than a paying guest.

I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a pleasant and respectful stay. There are many other options available where you can expect to be treated with the respect and kindness you deserve as a guest.

Breakfast
The breakfast was outstanding, offering a huge variety of choices every morning. From lovely scrambled eggs to smoked fish, there were different cooked options each day. We especially appreciated the organic food, the variety of meats, vegetables, and the fresh juice. The attention to detail was impressive, and it was evident that the staff took great pride in their service.

Staff and Service
The staff were incredibly kind and attentive, making us feel welcome and well cared for throughout our stay.

Location
The hotel is perfectly located, just a 2-minute walk from the main promenade and only 5 minutes from the World War II Museum. This made exploring Gdańsk extremely convenient.

Facilities
Parking was available right opposite the hotel for 70 zloty per day, which was very convenient for us. Our room was super clean and spacious, featuring an amazing walk-in shower and a very comfortable mattress. While the kid's bed could have been a bit better, it was still acceptable.

So when some people left, I was the only one in a space where people could not come anymore.

The bed was very uncomfortable. The upholstery on all the furniture was old and stained (it was rather gross). There was no fan in the bathroom/toilet.... There was no shower in the room only a bath. The ceiling was too low to stand up in the bathtub to take a shower and there was no blind on the bathroom window so half of Gdansk could see you naked. Also as this is a heritage building there was no lift, which means we had to carry our bags to the second floor, this was not a major issue for us, but I would not recommend staying there if you need a place that is accessible.

The location was great for us as the hotel was close enough to Old Town to easily walk there but it was in a quiet area. The view from our room was really good too.

The walls are thin. I could easily hear my neighbor. They woke me up at 0200 just by having a normal conversation. No yelling or loud voices but they were still able to wake me up(I am hypersensitive to noise though).
There is a small, free, gated parking lot and check-in is easy. The staff are all wonderful and speak English.
The rooms are large, clean, and comfortable(though 102 is a bit too pink). There is everything a five-star hotel is supposed to have(shoe shine supplies, robes, slippers). My room overlooked the canal with large windows. The bed and chairs were all comfortable. The bathroom is fantastic with a large tub and immediate hot water.
Location is great. A short walk to the main tourist area but far enough away to escape the noise.
Breakfast is fantastic. Good coffee and a made to order English Breakfast.

Because we had a car we could not stay in the centre. The car park is off the road which is good. Always had a space. We had one of the smallest rooms on the 2nd floor. 14 square metres. Cannot leave your case down. Similar to some hotel rooms we have stayed in, in Japan. No lifts. Steep steps. Noise will be a problem if you stay on the ""ground floor"" adjacent to reception. Rooms are not well sound proofed and you can hear everything your neighbours say, the TV and the doors closing. Obviously, it depends on your neighbours respecting the quiet hours, but, one night out of 4, some guests were loud until 3am in their room and then on the balcony. At least they were respecting the no smoking rule inside!!! To drown out the noise, we usually switch on the air con. Because the room was so small, the air con worked well. However, they had changed the remote control, which meant you could not turn off the bright light function, which showed the temperature. It would be impossible to sleep, had we not carefully covered the area with paper and tape. Even then, you would need an eye mask because the air con machine doubled as an ioniser and had bright blue lights running along the interior of the machine. The bed was, however, very comfortable.  Shower had good pressure, drained well, never ran out of hot water and was very clean, except the radiator bars ( rarely have I been to a place where every part on a towel rail are dust free). There was a kettle in the room. No fridge as advertised. Moving onto breakfast. Very good buffet with different hot selection of good quality sausages, bacon, cooked salmon, mackerel, sweet cheese pancake etc. This varied from day to day. Offered fresh scrambled eggs or fried. Asked for poached one day, but kitchen was unable to do it. Good coffee machine. Very friendly service and plates always cleared quickly. Talking of food. 3 supermarkets are 2 to 5 minutes away. Biedronka is opposite, then Lidl and the furthest one, Carrefour Express. Petrol station opposite too. 40 min walk to old town area going through the back steps behind Biedronka. Bus stops right outside, although we never used the bus.

Appreciate food made without oil as requested (doesn't nerd it, tasty enough without) Maybe lower price on cauliflower by ten zl.

The buffet style breakfast had an amazing array of choices to choose from and was very nice. The only negative issue was the cleaning staff. They never topped up our shower gel or hand gel once in the 4 days we stayed. We even had to ask the reception for shower gel and toilet roll. Also the cleaning quality was of poor standard. On our arrival we noticed a very dusty light fitting plug adapter that was very visible covered in dust. It still wasn't cleaned when we left! We just feel that there were no little extras - we could get things - but only if we asked. On the whole we enjoyed our stay very much, but feel it was more like a UK 3* star hotel not a 4*.

The breakfast was decent, featuring a good quality of food, though it became repetitive over our stay. The tea and coffee selection was nice, and I appreciated that there were allergen alternatives available. However, the setup was not quite as appealing as shown in the pictures.

On the positive side, the hotel is conveniently located close to the train station and the city center, making it easy to walk to various attractions. One downside was that you have to request room cleanup, which was a bit unexpected.

staff are friendly, kind, helpful with a grin smile. breakfast has diverse options and a few of them are changed newly so i could have plentiful food.

also, i have never found any dirt in the room and i could keep some food fresh in the fridge.

however, i really disliked the door lock - actual key. it is very outdated so i had to push the door and turned the key a few times and i could not get in the room when the key was inside it was automatically locked even though it is not electronic door lock system. also, i had to use the key to lock the door, which was very inconvenient.

since it is 21st century and everything is based on internet and advanced technology, i think all the door locks must be changed to card key. it was annoying to carry a big key with the room number light pad and took some time to open the door.

please find attached video showing how to open the door. those who are planning to stay needs to see it, otherwise you cannot enter your room.
i followed the instruction but it did not work because i did not pull the door with the key inserted into the lock just like the staff did.

the reason i couldn't open the door was that i put out the key first and tried to pull the door. and i still think it is the most strange way to come in and out the hotel room.
i was astonished and speechless about such an outdated system in the modern society!!🤯

so i cannot say it is value for money. it is quite expensive on a hotel with old facilities.
(city tax is not included the total price of the stay.)

also, as there was no mosquito net, i got mosquito bites on thighs and had to remove flies and mosquitoes coming from the window after maids cleaned up my room and opened the window. one of my photos is a dead fly on a white curtain... 😵‍💫😵

that is why i did not ask for room cleaning service on the following days.

and the elderly female guest next door was loudly talking and the fridge was bugging at night so it was quite hard to sleep even though i was exhausted, which means NO SOUNDPROOFING.

and wifi signal in the room was severely weak. it worked only in front of the room or pillow side of the bed. it kept disconnecting a lot of times as you see attached photos, CONNECTED WITHOUT INTERNET means NO CONNECTION, in other words.

thus, i had to use data network, which was limited for certain period for travel.
can you imagine  how much it was inconvenient during the stay?

lastly, dear the receptionists....
why do you charge city tax when checking out? it should have done upon check in!! i could miss the train because you dragged my time a bit, which led to miss the fastest bus to the main train station.
hopefully, i could catch the train by running out of the bus.

please be advised that you must mention the city tax upon check in if guests should pay it. because some guests have to be in a hurry when check out to catch the train / flight. ok??

i think your hotel is overrated considering outdated facilities including wifi, door lock",1727453568,False

Imagine different chefs may explain for the variations.

Appreciate food made without oil as requested (doesn't nerd it, tasty enough without) Maybe lower price on cauliflower by ten zl. Meat you eat at restauarants because chef won't overcook it but cauliflower you can buy for 5zl and microwave, steam, roast, no problem, I think more people would choose it if didn't have a close price point to ""proper"" food.

The ceiling was too low to stand up in the bathtub to take a shower and there was no blind on the bathroom window so half of Gdansk could see you naked.

The location was great for us as the hotel was close enough to Old Town to easily walk there but it was in a quiet area. The view from our room was really good too.

There is a small, free, gated parking lot and check-in is easy. The staff are all wonderful and speak English.

staff are friendly, kind, helpful with a grin smile. breakfast has diverse options and a few of them are changed newly so i could have plentiful food.

also, i have never found any dirt in the room and i could keep some food fresh in the fridge.

however, i really disliked the door lock - actual key. it is very outdated so i had to push the door and turned the key a few times and i could not get in the room when the key was inside it was automatically locked even though it is not electronic door lock system. also, i had to use the key to lock the door, which was very inconvenient.

since it is 21st century and everything is based on internet and advanced technology, i think all the door locks must be changed to card key. it was annoying to carry a big key with the room number light pad and took some time to open the door.

please find attached video showing how to open the door. those who are planning to stay needs to see it, otherwise you cannot enter your room.
i followed the instruction but it did not work because i did not pull the door with the key inserted into the lock just like the staff did.

the reason i couldn't open the door was that i put out the key first and tried to pull the door. and i still think it is the most strange way to come in and out the hotel room.
i was astonished and speechless about such an outdated system in the modern society!!🤯

so i cannot say it is value for money. it is quite expensive on a hotel with old facilities.
(city tax is not included the total price of the stay.)

also, as there was no mosquito net, i got mosquito bites on thighs and had to remove flies and mosquitoes coming from the window after maids cleaned up my room and opened the window. one of my photos is a dead fly on a white curtain... 😵‍💫😵

that is why i did not ask for room cleaning service on the following days.

and the elderly female guest next door was loudly talking and the fridge was bugging at night so it was quite hard to sleep even though i was exhausted, which means NO SOUNDPROOFING.

and wifi signal in the room was severely weak. it worked only in front of the room or pillow side of the bed. it kept disconnecting a lot of times as you see attached photos, CONNECTED WITHOUT INTERNET means NO CONNECTION, in other words.

thus, i had to use data network, which was limited for certain period for travel.
can you imagine  how much it was inconvenient during the stay?

lastly, dear the receptionists....
why do you charge city tax when checking out? it should have done upon check in!! i could miss the train because you dragged my time a bit, which led to miss the fastest bus to the main train station.
hopefully, i could catch the train by running out of the bus.

please be advised that you must mention the city tax upon check in if guests should pay it. because some guests have to be in a hurry when check out to catch the train / flight. ok??

i think your hotel is overrated considering outdated facilities including wifi, door lock",1727453568,False

Breakfast
The breakfast was outstanding, offering a huge variety of choices every morning. From lovely scrambled eggs to smoked fish, there were different cooked options each day. We especially appreciated the organic food, the variety of meats, vegetables, and the fresh juice. The attention to detail was impressive, and it was evident that the staff took great pride in their service.

Staff and Service
The staff were incredibly kind and attentive, making us feel welcome and well cared for throughout our stay.

Location
The hotel is perfectly located, just a 2-minute walk from the main promenade and only 5 minutes from the World War II Museum. This made exploring Gdańsk extremely convenient.

Facilities
Parking was available right opposite the hotel for 70 zloty per day, which was very convenient for us. Our room was super clean and spacious, featuring an amazing walk-in shower and a very comfortable mattress. While the kid's bed could have been a bit better, it was still acceptable.

ChIJ38o-iaZz_UYRUeXS9yx7hJU,Soo H,en,en,2,a month ago,"i liked staff, breakfast, room's cleaness.

staff are friendly, kind, helpful with a grin smile. breakfast has diverse options and a few of them are changed newly so i could have plentiful food.

also, i have never found any dirt in the room and i could keep some food fresh in the fridge.

however, i really disliked the door lock - actual key. it is very outdated so i had to push the door and turned the key a few times and i could not get in the room when the key was inside it was automatically locked even though it is not electronic door lock system. also, i had to use the key to lock the door, which was very inconvenient.

since it is 21st century and everything is based on internet and advanced technology, i think all the door locks must be changed to card key. it was annoying to carry a big key with the room number light pad and took some time to open the door.

please find attached video showing how to open the door. those who are planning to stay needs to see it, otherwise you cannot enter your room.
i followed the instruction but it did not work because i did not pull the door with the key inserted into the lock just like the staff did.

the reason i couldn't open the door was that i put out the key first and tried to pull the door. and i still think it is the most strange way to come in and out the hotel room.
i was astonished and speechless about such an outdated system in the modern society!!🤯

so i cannot say it is value for money. it is quite expensive on a hotel with old facilities.
(city tax is not included the total price of the stay.)

also, as there was no mosquito net, i got mosquito bites on thighs and had to remove flies and mosquitoes coming from the window after maids cleaned up my room and opened the window. one of my photos is a dead fly on a white curtain... 😵‍💫😵

that is why i did not ask for room cleaning service on the following days.

and the elderly female guest next door was loudly talking and the fridge was bugging at night so it was quite hard to sleep even though i was exhausted, which means NO SOUNDPROOFING.

and wifi signal in the room was severely weak. it worked only in front of the room or pillow side of the bed. it kept disconnecting a lot of times as you see attached photos, CONNECTED WITHOUT INTERNET means NO CONNECTION, in other words.

thus, i had to use data network, which was limited for certain period for travel.
can you imagine  how much it was inconvenient during the stay?

lastly, dear the receptionists....
why do you charge city tax when checking out? it should have done upon check in!! i could miss the train because you dragged my time a bit, which led to miss the fastest bus to the main train station.
hopefully, i could catch the train by running out of the bus.

please be advised that you must mention the city tax upon check in if guests should pay it. because some guests have to be in a hurry when check out to catch the train / flight. ok??

i think your hotel is overrated considering outdated facilities including wifi, door lock",1727453568,False

The ceiling was too low to stand up in the bathtub to take a shower and there was no blind on the bathroom window so half of Gdansk could see you naked.

The location was great for us as the hotel was close enough to Old Town to easily walk there but it was in a quiet area. The view from our room was really good too.

The main reason for this being a 2 star review, rather than 1 star, was that the lady who managed the place was absolutely lovely and very helpful.",1706498299,False
ChIJKZjkdApz_UYRaq5_fZCcUa8,DavidB blog,en,en,4,a year ago,"A small, lovely hotel with one negative.
The walls are thin. I could easily hear my neighbor. They woke me up at 0200 just by having a normal conversation. No yelling or loud voices but they were still able to wake me up(I am hypersensitive to noise though).
There is a small, free, gated parking lot and check-in is easy. The staff are all wonderful and speak English.
The rooms are large, clean, and comfortable(though 102 is a bit too pink). There is everything a five-star hotel is supposed to have(shoe shine supplies, robes, slippers). My room overlooked the canal with large windows. The bed and chairs were all comfortable. The bathroom is fantastic with a large tub and immediate hot water.
Location is great. A short walk to the main tourist area but far enough away to escape the noise.
Breakfast is fantastic. Good coffee and a made to order English Breakfast.
I would love to stay here again because of so many positives, but noise is a red-line for me so I will find somewhere else next time I am in Gdansk.",1680253677,False

Because we had a car we could not stay in the centre. The car park is off the road which is good. Always had a space. We had one of the smallest rooms on the 2nd floor. 14 square metres. Cannot leave your case down. Similar to some hotel rooms we have stayed in, in Japan. No lifts. Steep steps. Noise will be a problem if you stay on the ""ground floor"" adjacent to reception. Rooms are not well sound proofed and you can hear everything your neighbours say, the TV and the doors closing. Obviously, it depends on your neighbours respecting the quiet hours, but, one night out of 4, some guests were loud until 3am in their room and then on the balcony. At least they were respecting the no smoking rule inside!!! To drown out the noise, we usually switch on the air con. Because the room was so small, the air con worked well. However, they had changed the remote control, which meant you could not turn off the bright light function, which showed the temperature. It would be impossible to sleep, had we not carefully covered the area with paper and tape. Even then, you would need an eye mask because the air con machine doubled as an ioniser and had bright blue lights running along the interior of the machine. The bed was, however, very comfortable.  Shower had good pressure, drained well, never ran out of hot water and was very clean, except the radiator bars ( rarely have I been to a place where every part on a towel rail are dust free). There was a kettle in the room. No fridge as advertised. Moving onto breakfast. Very good buffet with different hot selection of good quality sausages, bacon, cooked salmon, mackerel, sweet cheese pancake etc. This varied from day to day. Offered fresh scrambled eggs or fried. Asked for poached one day, but kitchen was unable to do it. Good coffee machine. Very friendly service and plates always cleared quickly. Talking of food. 3 supermarkets are 2 to 5 minutes away. Biedronka is opposite, then Lidl and the furthest one, Carrefour Express. Petrol station opposite too. 40 min walk to old town area going through the back steps behind Biedronka. Bus stops right outside, although we never used the bus.

Imagine different chefs may explain for the variations.

Appreciate food made without oil as requested (doesn't nerd it, tasty enough without) Maybe lower price on cauliflower by ten zl.

Breakfast
The breakfast was outstanding, offering a huge variety of choices every morning. From lovely scrambled eggs to smoked fish, there were different cooked options each day. We especially appreciated the organic food, the variety of meats, vegetables, and the fresh juice. The attention to detail was impressive, and it was evident that the staff took great pride in their service.

Staff and Service

The hotel is perfectly located, just a 2-minute walk from the main promenade and only 5 minutes from the World War II Museum. This made exploring Gdańsk extremely convenient.

Parking was available right opposite the hotel for 70 zloty per day, which was very convenient for us. Our room was super clean and spacious, featuring an amazing walk-in shower and a very comfortable mattress. While the kid's bed could have been a bit better, it was still acceptable.

The breakfast was decent, featuring a good quality of food, though it became repetitive over our stay. The tea and coffee selection was nice, and I appreciated that there were allergen alternatives available. However, the setup was not quite as appealing as shown in the pictures.

On the positive side, the hotel is conveniently located close to the train station and the city center, making it easy to walk to various attractions. One downside was that you have to request room cleanup, which was a bit unexpected.

staff are friendly, kind, helpful with a grin smile. breakfast has diverse options and a few of them are changed newly so i could have plentiful food.

also, i have never found any dirt in the room and i could keep some food fresh in the fridge.

however, i really disliked the door lock - actual key. it is very outdated so i had to push the door and turned the key a few times and i could not get in the room when the key was inside it was automatically locked even though it is not electronic door lock system. also, i had to use the key to lock the door, which was very inconvenient.

since it is 21st century and everything is based on internet and advanced technology, i think all the door locks must be changed to card key. it was annoying to carry a big key with the room number light pad and took some time to open the door.

please find attached video showing how to open the door. those who are planning to stay needs to see it, otherwise you cannot enter your room.
i followed the instruction but it did not work because i did not pull the door with the key inserted into the lock just like the staff did.

the reason i couldn't open the door was that i put out the key first and tried to pull the door. and i still think it is the most strange way to come in and out the hotel room.
i was astonished and speechless about such an outdated system in the modern society!!🤯

so i cannot say it is value for money. it is quite expensive on a hotel with old facilities.
(city tax is not included the total price of the stay.)

also, as there was no mosquito net, i got mosquito bites on thighs and had to remove flies and mosquitoes coming from the window after maids cleaned up my room and opened the window. one of my photos is a dead fly on a white curtain... 😵‍💫😵

that is why i did not ask for room cleaning service on the following days.

and the elderly female guest next door was loudly talking and the fridge was bugging at night so it was quite hard to sleep even though i was exhausted, which means NO SOUNDPROOFING.

and wifi signal in the room was severely weak. it worked only in front of the room or pillow side of the bed. it kept disconnecting a lot of times as you see attached photos, CONNECTED WITHOUT INTERNET means NO CONNECTION, in other words.

thus, i had to use data network, which was limited for certain period for travel.
can you imagine  how much it was inconvenient during the stay?

lastly, dear the receptionists....
why do you charge city tax when checking out? it should have done upon check in!! i could miss the train because you dragged my time a bit, which led to miss the fastest bus to the main train station.
hopefully, i could catch the train by running out of the bus.

please be advised that you must mention the city tax upon check in if guests should pay it. because some guests have to be in a hurry when check out to catch the train / flight. ok??

i think your hotel is overrated considering outdated facilities including wifi, door lock",1727453568,False

Imagine different chefs may explain for the variations.

Appreciate food made without oil as requested (doesn't nerd it, tasty enough without) Maybe lower price on cauliflower by ten zl. Meat you eat at restauarants because chef won't overcook it but cauliflower you can buy for 5zl and microwave, steam, roast, no problem, I think more people would choose it if didn't have a close price point to ""proper"" food.

ChIJTwV0vdXKG0cRN66-QEWaVLc,R VS,en,en,1,2 months ago,"Our recent stay at the Grand Hotel Lodz was a deeply disappointing experience, especially considering it was supposed to be the highlight of our honeymoon. The hotel itself is undeniably beautiful, having recently undergone renovations that have left it with high-quality furniture and a stylish design. The attention to detail in the decor is evident, and the rooms are quite comfortable. However, the service we encountered was appalling and far from the five-star standard the hotel claims to offer.
Our stay was marred by numerous issues, starting with the lack of recognition for our special occasion. Despite informing the hotel in advance that it was our honeymoon, we received no personalized greeting or acknowledgment—no card, no warm wishes, nothing. This set a cold tone for the rest of our stay, which only got worse from there.
The reception staff were particularly unprofessional. Most of the time, they would hide behind their PC screens, avoiding eye contact, and barely acknowledging our presence. It's rare to find a luxury hotel where the front desk staff are so disengaged and impersonal.
Breakfast, which should have been a delightful start to our day, turned into an ordeal. Although the food was of exceptional quality, the service was the worst we have ever experienced. It took 30 minutes for someone to take our order, and an unbelievable 1 hour and 30 minutes for the food to arrive—when it did, they had forgotten to bring drinks. When we reminded them, they asked us to wait and then simply forgot about us again. There were 3 waiters for 9 tables. The absence of a room manager was glaringly obvious, and the disorganized staff seemed overwhelmed and inattentive.
The spa, while visually stunning, proved to be another source of frustration. The spa's flooring, which is the same as in the lobby, became dangerously slippery when wet. My husband slipped and hurt his hip near the pool, and no staff members were around to assist him. The flooring in this area is clearly a hazard, and the hotel should expect lawsuits if this dangerous situation is not addressed immediately. The lack of concern for guest safety is not only unprofessional but also potentially legally negligent.
Housekeeping was equally disappointing. On the first day, they forgot to restock basic amenities like shampoo and shower gel. We had to call reception, and it took 4 hours and 30 minutes for them to bring the items to our room. By then, we had already purchased our own products from a nearby supermarket. The hotel’s evident cost-cutting on amenities is both frustrating and inconvenient.
Upon checkout, the final blow came when no one bothered to ask how our stay was. The staff were entirely focused on processing payments, showing no interest in guest satisfaction. This lack of hospitality and personal touch left us feeling like just another transaction rather than valued guests.
In conclusion, while the Grand Hotel Lodz boasts a beautiful property with top-notch design, the abysmal service makes it impossible to recommend. The overall experience was incredibly disappointing, especially for a honeymoon stay. The hotel desperately needs to improve its service standards if it hopes to live up to its five-star rating. Until then, guests should be aware of the risks, both in terms of service and safety.",1723970830,False

The food is rather tasty (although I have eaten better), but the price-quality ratio is not good - about PLN 150 per person without wine and dessert (starter, soup and second). Still, it would be good if it weren't for the staff.
1. Be careful when arranging details by phone - with each change, the price per person increases imperceptibly. It's better to have everything in writing on the spot. The owner was reluctant to send the quote.
2. There may be a problem with parking spaces - the premises do not provide any space, and the owner warns against parking in the courtyard, says it is forbidden, but there is no sign. It's better to remember this, because I parked in the courtyard on the day of the event and received an unpleasant scolding. The adjacent parking lot is paid, but there is still a street.
3. The waiter looks like he knows his stuff, but somehow he didn't really feel like attending our party because: he didn't announce food, just ""please eat, it's getting cold."" He seemed to want us out as soon as possible. Moreover, there was a fee for coffee and tea for the guests, but never once did anyone ask the guests if they wanted coffee or tea. And at the end of the party, when I asked for the rest of the leftover food to be packed, I had to pay for a couple of takeout boxes. Inelegant.
4. The general impression of the event is one of an almost deathly atmosphere among the guests, caused by the reluctant and unfriendly attitude of the owner and the staff of the premises. As if we were to have the honor of visiting the Lord in his own palace, and the Lord is doing us an extraordinary favor by allowing us to be here. Unfortunately, neither I nor my guests want to come here anymore, even despite the charms of this palace. Well, unless the owner and staff change.",1688037458,True

The hotel itself is undeniably beautiful, having recently undergone renovations that have left it with high-quality furniture and a stylish design. The attention to detail in the decor is evident, and the rooms are quite comfortable. However, the service we encountered was appalling and far from the five-star standard the hotel claims to offer.
Our stay was marred by numerous issues, starting with the lack of recognition for our special occasion. Despite informing the hotel in advance that it was our honeymoon, we received no personalized greeting or acknowledgment—no card, no warm wishes, nothing. This set a cold tone for the rest of our stay, which only got worse from there.
The reception staff were particularly unprofessional. Most of the time, they would hide behind their PC screens, avoiding eye contact, and barely acknowledging our presence. It's rare to find a luxury hotel where the front desk staff are so disengaged and impersonal.
Breakfast, which should have been a delightful start to our day, turned into an ordeal. Although the food was of exceptional quality, the service was the worst we have ever experienced. It took 30 minutes for someone to take our order, and an unbelievable 1 hour and 30 minutes for the food to arrive—when it did, they had forgotten to bring drinks. When we reminded them, they asked us to wait and then simply forgot about us again. There were 3 waiters for 9 tables. The absence of a room manager was glaringly obvious, and the disorganized staff seemed overwhelmed and inattentive.
The spa, while visually stunning, proved to be another source of frustration. The spa's flooring, which is the same as in the lobby, became dangerously slippery when wet. My husband slipped and hurt his hip near the pool, and no staff members were around to assist him. The flooring in this area is clearly a hazard, and the hotel should expect lawsuits if this dangerous situation is not addressed immediately. The lack of concern for guest safety is not only unprofessional but also potentially legally negligent.
Housekeeping was equally disappointing. On the first day, they forgot to restock basic amenities like shampoo and shower gel. We had to call reception, and it took 4 hours and 30 minutes for them to bring the items to our room. By then, we had already purchased our own products from a nearby supermarket. The hotel’s evident cost-cutting on amenities is both frustrating and inconvenient.
Upon checkout, the final blow came when no one bothered to ask how our stay was. The staff were entirely focused on processing payments, showing no interest in guest satisfaction. This lack of hospitality and personal touch left us feeling like just another transaction rather than valued guests.
In conclusion, while the Grand Hotel Lodz boasts a beautiful property with top-notch design, the abysmal service makes it impossible to recommend. The overall experience was incredibly disappointing, especially for a honeymoon stay. The hotel desperately needs to improve its service standards if it hopes to live up to its five-star rating. Until then, guests should be aware of the risks, both in terms of service and safety.",1723970830,False

The food is rather tasty (although I have eaten better), but the price-quality ratio is not good - about PLN 150 per person without wine and dessert (starter, soup and second). Still, it would be good if it weren't for the staff.
1. Be careful when arranging details by phone - with each change, the price per person increases imperceptibly. It's better to have everything in writing on the spot. The owner was reluctant to send the quote.
2. There may be a problem with parking spaces - the premises do not provide any space, and the owner warns against parking in the courtyard, says it is forbidden, but there is no sign. It's better to remember this, because I parked in the courtyard on the day of the event and received an unpleasant scolding. The adjacent parking lot is paid, but there is still a street.
3. The waiter looks like he knows his stuff, but somehow he didn't really feel like attending our party because: he didn't announce food, just ""please eat, it's getting cold."" He seemed to want us out as soon as possible. Moreover, there was a fee for coffee and tea for the guests, but never once did anyone ask the guests if they wanted coffee or tea. And at the end of the party, when I asked for the rest of the leftover food to be packed, I had to pay for a couple of takeout boxes. Inelegant.
4. The general impression of the event is one of an almost deathly atmosphere among the guests, caused by the reluctant and unfriendly attitude of the owner and the staff of the premises. As if we were to have the honor of visiting the Lord in his own palace, and the Lord is doing us an extraordinary favor by allowing us to be here.

ChIJTwV0vdXKG0cRN66-QEWaVLc,R VS,en,en,1,2 months ago,"Our recent stay at the Grand Hotel Lodz was a deeply disappointing experience, especially considering it was supposed to be the highlight of our honeymoon. The hotel itself is undeniably beautiful, having recently undergone renovations that have left it with high-quality furniture and a stylish design. The attention to detail in the decor is evident, and the rooms are quite comfortable. However, the service we encountered was appalling and far from the five-star standard the hotel claims to offer.
Our stay was marred by numerous issues, starting with the lack of recognition for our special occasion. Despite informing the hotel in advance that it was our honeymoon, we received no personalized greeting or acknowledgment—no card, no warm wishes, nothing. This set a cold tone for the rest of our stay, which only got worse from there.
The reception staff were particularly unprofessional. Most of the time, they would hide behind their PC screens, avoiding eye contact, and barely acknowledging our presence. It's rare to find a luxury hotel where the front desk staff are so disengaged and impersonal.
Breakfast, which should have been a delightful start to our day, turned into an ordeal. Although the food was of exceptional quality, the service was the worst we have ever experienced. It took 30 minutes for someone to take our order, and an unbelievable 1 hour and 30 minutes for the food to arrive—when it did, they had forgotten to bring drinks. When we reminded them, they asked us to wait and then simply forgot about us again. There were 3 waiters for 9 tables. The absence of a room manager was glaringly obvious, and the disorganized staff seemed overwhelmed and inattentive.
The spa, while visually stunning, proved to be another source of frustration. The spa's flooring, which is the same as in the lobby, became dangerously slippery when wet. My husband slipped and hurt his hip near the pool, and no staff members were around to assist him. The flooring in this area is clearly a hazard, and the hotel should expect lawsuits if this dangerous situation is not addressed immediately. The lack of concern for guest safety is not only unprofessional but also potentially legally negligent.
Housekeeping was equally disappointing. On the first day, they forgot to restock basic amenities like shampoo and shower gel. We had to call reception, and it took 4 hours and 30 minutes for them to bring the items to our room. By then, we had already purchased our own products from a nearby supermarket. The hotel’s evident cost-cutting on amenities is both frustrating and inconvenient.
Upon checkout, the final blow came when no one bothered to ask how our stay was. The staff were entirely focused on processing payments, showing no interest in guest satisfaction. This lack of hospitality and personal touch left us feeling like just another transaction rather than valued guests.
In conclusion, while the Grand Hotel Lodz boasts a beautiful property with top-notch design, the abysmal service makes it impossible to recommend. The overall experience was incredibly disappointing, especially for a honeymoon stay. The hotel desperately needs to improve its service standards if it hopes to live up to its five-star rating. Until then, guests should be aware of the risks, both in terms of service and safety.",1723970830,False

The food is rather tasty (although I have eaten better), but the price-quality ratio is not good - about PLN 150 per person without wine and dessert (starter, soup and second). Still, it would be good if it weren't for the staff.
1. Be careful when arranging details by phone - with each change, the price per person increases imperceptibly. It's better to have everything in writing on the spot. The owner was reluctant to send the quote.
2. There may be a problem with parking spaces - the premises do not provide any space, and the owner warns against parking in the courtyard, says it is forbidden, but there is no sign. It's better to remember this, because I parked in the courtyard on the day of the event and received an unpleasant scolding. The adjacent parking lot is paid, but there is still a street.
3. The waiter looks like he knows his stuff, but somehow he didn't really feel like attending our party because: he didn't announce food, just ""please eat, it's getting cold."" He seemed to want us out as soon as possible. Moreover, there was a fee for coffee and tea for the guests, but never once did anyone ask the guests if they wanted coffee or tea. And at the end of the party, when I asked for the rest of the leftover food to be packed, I had to pay for a couple of takeout boxes. Inelegant.
4. The general impression of the event is one of an almost deathly atmosphere among the guests, caused by the reluctant and unfriendly attitude of the owner and the staff of the premises. As if we were to have the honor of visiting the Lord in his own palace, and the Lord is doing us an extraordinary favor by allowing us to be here. Unfortunately, neither I nor my guests want to come here anymore, even despite the charms of this palace. Well, unless the owner and staff change.",1688037458,True

ChIJTwV0vdXKG0cRN66-QEWaVLc,R VS,en,en,1,2 months ago,"Our recent stay at the Grand Hotel Lodz was a deeply disappointing experience, especially considering it was supposed to be the highlight of our honeymoon. The hotel itself is undeniably beautiful, having recently undergone renovations that have left it with high-quality furniture and a stylish design. The attention to detail in the decor is evident, and the rooms are quite comfortable. However, the service we encountered was appalling and far from the five-star standard the hotel claims to offer.
Our stay was marred by numerous issues, starting with the lack of recognition for our special occasion. Despite informing the hotel in advance that it was our honeymoon, we received no personalized greeting or acknowledgment—no card, no warm wishes, nothing. This set a cold tone for the rest of our stay, which only got worse from there.
The reception staff were particularly unprofessional. Most of the time, they would hide behind their PC screens, avoiding eye contact, and barely acknowledging our presence. It's rare to find a luxury hotel where the front desk staff are so disengaged and impersonal.
Breakfast, which should have been a delightful start to our day, turned into an ordeal. Although the food was of exceptional quality, the service was the worst we have ever experienced. It took 30 minutes for someone to take our order, and an unbelievable 1 hour and 30 minutes for the food to arrive—when it did, they had forgotten to bring drinks. When we reminded them, they asked us to wait and then simply forgot about us again. There were 3 waiters for 9 tables. The absence of a room manager was glaringly obvious, and the disorganized staff seemed overwhelmed and inattentive.
The spa, while visually stunning, proved to be another source of frustration. The spa's flooring, which is the same as in the lobby, became dangerously slippery when wet. My husband slipped and hurt his hip near the pool, and no staff members were around to assist him. The flooring in this area is clearly a hazard, and the hotel should expect lawsuits if this dangerous situation is not addressed immediately. The lack of concern for guest safety is not only unprofessional but also potentially legally negligent.
Housekeeping was equally disappointing. On the first day, they forgot to restock basic amenities like shampoo and shower gel. We had to call reception, and it took 4 hours and 30 minutes for them to bring the items to our room. By then, we had already purchased our own products from a nearby supermarket. The hotel’s evident cost-cutting on amenities is both frustrating and inconvenient.
Upon checkout, the final blow came when no one bothered to ask how our stay was. The staff were entirely focused on processing payments, showing no interest in guest satisfaction. This lack of hospitality and personal touch left us feeling like just another transaction rather than valued guests.
In conclusion, while the Grand Hotel Lodz boasts a beautiful property with top-notch design, the abysmal service makes it impossible to recommend. The overall experience was incredibly disappointing, especially for a honeymoon stay. The hotel desperately needs to improve its service standards if it hopes to live up to its five-star rating.

The food is rather tasty (although I have eaten better), but the price-quality ratio is not good - about PLN 150 per person without wine and dessert (starter, soup and second). Still, it would be good if it weren't for the staff.
1. Be careful when arranging details by phone - with each change, the price per person increases imperceptibly. It's better to have everything in writing on the spot. The owner was reluctant to send the quote.
2. There may be a problem with parking spaces - the premises do not provide any space, and the owner warns against parking in the courtyard, says it is forbidden, but there is no sign. It's better to remember this, because I parked in the courtyard on the day of the event and received an unpleasant scolding. The adjacent parking lot is paid, but there is still a street.
3. The waiter looks like he knows his stuff, but somehow he didn't really feel like attending our party because: he didn't announce food, just ""please eat, it's getting cold."" He seemed to want us out as soon as possible. Moreover, there was a fee for coffee and tea for the guests, but never once did anyone ask the guests if they wanted coffee or tea. And at the end of the party, when I asked for the rest of the leftover food to be packed, I had to pay for a couple of takeout boxes. Inelegant.
4. The general impression of the event is one of an almost deathly atmosphere among the guests, caused by the reluctant and unfriendly attitude of the owner and the staff of the premises. As if we were to have the honor of visiting the Lord in his own palace, and the Lord is doing us an extraordinary favor by allowing us to be here. Unfortunately, neither I nor my guests want to come here anymore, even despite the charms of this palace. Well, unless the owner and staff change.",1688037458,True

ChIJTwV0vdXKG0cRN66-QEWaVLc,R VS,en,en,1,2 months ago,"Our recent stay at the Grand Hotel Lodz was a deeply disappointing experience, especially considering it was supposed to be the highlight of our honeymoon. The hotel itself is undeniably beautiful, having recently undergone renovations that have left it with high-quality furniture and a stylish design. The attention to detail in the decor is evident, and the rooms are quite comfortable. However, the service we encountered was appalling and far from the five-star standard the hotel claims to offer.
Our stay was marred by numerous issues, starting with the lack of recognition for our special occasion. Despite informing the hotel in advance that it was our honeymoon, we received no personalized greeting or acknowledgment—no card, no warm wishes, nothing. This set a cold tone for the rest of our stay, which only got worse from there.
The reception staff were particularly unprofessional. Most of the time, they would hide behind their PC screens, avoiding eye contact, and barely acknowledging our presence. It's rare to find a luxury hotel where the front desk staff are so disengaged and impersonal.
Breakfast, which should have been a delightful start to our day, turned into an ordeal. Although the food was of exceptional quality, the service was the worst we have ever experienced. It took 30 minutes for someone to take our order, and an unbelievable 1 hour and 30 minutes for the food to arrive—when it did, they had forgotten to bring drinks. When we reminded them, they asked us to wait and then simply forgot about us again. There were 3 waiters for 9 tables. The absence of a room manager was glaringly obvious, and the disorganized staff seemed overwhelmed and inattentive.
The spa, while visually stunning, proved to be another source of frustration. The spa's flooring, which is the same as in the lobby, became dangerously slippery when wet. My husband slipped and hurt his hip near the pool, and no staff members were around to assist him. The flooring in this area is clearly a hazard, and the hotel should expect lawsuits if this dangerous situation is not addressed immediately. The lack of concern for guest safety is not only unprofessional but also potentially legally negligent.
Housekeeping was equally disappointing. On the first day, they forgot to restock basic amenities like shampoo and shower gel. We had to call reception, and it took 4 hours and 30 minutes for them to bring the items to our room. By then, we had already purchased our own products from a nearby supermarket. The hotel’s evident cost-cutting on amenities is both frustrating and inconvenient.
Upon checkout, the final blow came when no one bothered to ask how our stay was. The staff were entirely focused on processing payments, showing no interest in guest satisfaction. This lack of hospitality and personal touch left us feeling like just another transaction rather than valued guests.
In conclusion, while the Grand Hotel Lodz boasts a beautiful property with top-notch design, the abysmal service makes it impossible to recommend. The overall experience was incredibly disappointing, especially for a honeymoon stay. The hotel desperately needs to improve its service standards if it hopes to live up to its five-star rating. Until then, guests should be aware of the risks, both in terms of service and safety.",1723970830,False

The food is rather tasty (although I have eaten better), but the price-quality ratio is not good - about PLN 150 per person without wine and dessert (starter, soup and second). Still, it would be good if it weren't for the staff.
1. Be careful when arranging details by phone - with each change, the price per person increases imperceptibly. It's better to have everything in writing on the spot. The owner was reluctant to send the quote.
2. There may be a problem with parking spaces - the premises do not provide any space, and the owner warns against parking in the courtyard, says it is forbidden, but there is no sign. It's better to remember this, because I parked in the courtyard on the day of the event and received an unpleasant scolding. The adjacent parking lot is paid, but there is still a street.
3. The waiter looks like he knows his stuff, but somehow he didn't really feel like attending our party because: he didn't announce food, just ""please eat, it's getting cold."" He seemed to want us out as soon as possible. Moreover, there was a fee for coffee and tea for the guests, but never once did anyone ask the guests if they wanted coffee or tea. And at the end of the party, when I asked for the rest of the leftover food to be packed, I had to pay for a couple of takeout boxes. Inelegant.
4. The general impression of the event is one of an almost deathly atmosphere among the guests, caused by the reluctant and unfriendly attitude of the owner and the staff of the premises. As if we were to have the honor of visiting the Lord in his own palace, and the Lord is doing us an extraordinary favor by allowing us to be here.

Each bite was a delightful mix of crunch and smoothness, seasoned to perfection with a harmonious blend of spices that accentuated the natural flavors of the potato.

My friend opted for the Crispy Pork Loin accompanied by potatoes. This dish was a testament to the kitchen's skill in balancing flavors and textures. The pork loin was cooked to a succulent crispiness, enveloping a tender, juicy interior. Paired with well-seasoned, fluffy potatoes, it created a satisfying, hearty meal that left us both impressed.

The service at Restauracja Zaklęty Czardasz was equally commendable. The staff was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, making our dining experience smooth and enjoyable. They were quick to offer suggestions and ensure that all our needs were met promptly.

Each bite was a delightful mix of crunch and smoothness, seasoned to perfection with a harmonious blend of spices that accentuated the natural flavors of the potato.

My friend opted for the Crispy Pork Loin accompanied by potatoes. This dish was a testament to the kitchen's skill in balancing flavors and textures. The pork loin was cooked to a succulent crispiness, enveloping a tender, juicy interior. Paired with well-seasoned, fluffy potatoes, it created a satisfying, hearty meal that left us both impressed.

The service at Restauracja Zaklęty Czardasz was equally commendable. The staff was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, making our dining experience smooth and enjoyable. They were quick to offer suggestions and ensure that all our needs were met promptly.

My friend opted for the Crispy Pork Loin accompanied by potatoes. This dish was a testament to the kitchen's skill in balancing flavors and textures. The pork loin was cooked to a succulent crispiness, enveloping a tender, juicy interior. Paired with well-seasoned, fluffy potatoes, it created a satisfying, hearty meal that left us both impressed.

The highlight for me was the Hungarian-style potato pancake. This dish was a culinary masterpiece, boasting a perfectly crispy texture that contrasted beautifully with the creamy, tangy sour cream. Each bite was a delightful mix of crunch and smoothness, seasoned to perfection with a harmonious blend of spices that accentuated the natural flavors of the potato.

My friend opted for the Crispy Pork Loin accompanied by potatoes. This dish was a testament to the kitchen's skill in balancing flavors and textures. The pork loin was cooked to a succulent crispiness, enveloping a tender, juicy interior. Paired with well-seasoned, fluffy potatoes, it created a satisfying, hearty meal that left us both impressed.

The service at Restauracja Zaklęty Czardasz was equally commendable. The staff was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, making our dining experience smooth and enjoyable. They were quick to offer suggestions and ensure that all our needs were met promptly.

My friend opted for the Crispy Pork Loin accompanied by potatoes. This dish was a testament to the kitchen's skill in balancing flavors and textures. The pork loin was cooked to a succulent crispiness, enveloping a tender, juicy interior. Paired with well-seasoned, fluffy potatoes, it created a satisfying, hearty meal that left us both impressed.

The service at Restauracja Zaklęty Czardasz was equally commendable. The staff was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, making our dining experience smooth and enjoyable. They were quick to offer suggestions and ensure that all our needs were met promptly.

In the evening and during the night, you can see these hanging on the building facade, in the hallways and in the rooms. Ranging from 1 cm to 4-5 cm. The hotel explanation was that it is near the river. These spiders are seen all over the town, so it is something linked to the area, not the river. The low level restaurant and the breakfast area are clean, so it is obvious that these are vacuumed regularly.
Upon entering my room, I had to get rid of 15 spiders. These are not venomous, but can leave ugly blemishes if you are unlucky to have one on you during sleep, in your clothes, shoes and so on. Rooms do not have AC and the only way to get fresh air is through the windows, which do not have any meshes to stop insects going into rooms. I had to leave my door opened to the hotel hallways and watch for anything that might crawl inside.
The personnel is friendly, rooms are not that clean, the in house beer is quite good and that`s about it. Spraying the local vegetation and the building facade, plus regular vacuuming of the nests and installing window meshes, will make a huge difference.
Other than this, I do not recommend this hotel and it is too bad, because it has a huge potential, historical background, plus in-house beer.

The Employees:  Delightful, professional, and efficient!

This is a charming restaurant with an exceptional staff providing exceptional food. We have dined here on at least six different trips to Lubin and have never been disappointed.

The restaurant is clean and refreshing.  The unique decor reveals charming relics from the days of earlier railroads and is brightened with charming wall paintings and decor.

There are two rooms with tables, one more formal than the other. Also available are private alcoves for couples and a larger private dining room for groups.

The menu is well balanced, the food from soups to dinner to dessert is exceptional, and the staff is extremely helpful and will always go out of their way to improve your experience.

Access to the restaurant is accessible from the service road, and parking space is adequate.

The mystery is the contrast between this exceptional restaurant and the abysmal hotel rooms offered upstairs.

**************************************************

The Hotel:  1/2 star because it is not a tent! Horrible!

THE GOOD:
•	Employees:  Delightful, professional, and as helpful as possible, given the deplorable condition of the rooms.

THE BAD:
•	The Health Authorities have failed to protect the public and shut it down!

•	The people who wrote positive reviews are possibly  comparing the hotel to their time in prison.

•	Heat: The antique Wall mounted Heat & air-conditioning units do not produce heat! It is unlikely, therefore, that they cool.

•	Stench? Yes, everything.

•	Beds? Nightmare!  Better if you sleep in your car.

•	The Apartment: Painful! You gain approximately 6 meters square and most of that is filled with a very uncomfortable sofa-bed.  One of the two doors to the balcony works. The other is too old and damaged to open. Cold air balances the street noise penetrating without pity.

•	The bathroom fixtures do not yet qualify as antiques.

The prices charged for a room are similar to the modern Hilton, the lovely Ibis, or the fantastic Piano Hotel.

Ordered a 29zl burger with duck and goat cheese. Dish was very dull, dry and simply unpalatable. Buns enclosing the salty cheese and duck were literally drenched in fat creating a gush of oil as the spongy bread was chewed and released it's excess in your mouth. The duck meat is best described as duck scraps that have been fried too long (or perhaps too often). There was no pickle to break up the blandness.

Out of desperation for something sour I requested ketchup (I known) but was told such a ramekin of precious condiment would cost 5 zl. At that point I gave up and only kept the dish long enough to snap a photo, hoping my bad experience would serve as a warning to others.
Fries were crispy, but had the bitter aftertaste of rancid oil.

First of all, a wedding house that meets my expectations must have the right atmosphere. It is important that the place exudes coziness and elegance, creating an unforgettable atmosphere for guests and newlyweds. Aesthetic interiors, appropriate lighting and tasteful decoration are extremely important.

Another important factor is staff. Competent and friendly service influences the entire atmosphere of the event. Employees should be professional, discreet and ready to meet all needs and expectations. Good staff can really elevate the service and make it a special day for everyone in attendance.

Of course, one of the key aspects is the menu. As a lover of good food, I expect the wedding venue to provide high-quality food that is tasty and fresh. Menu variety is also important to meet the different tastes of guests. In addition, professional waiter service, which ensures that no one feels hungry or unserved, is extremely important.

Infrastructure is another aspect that I took into account when choosing a wedding venue. Large and spacious rooms, well-equipped toilets, comfortable parking spaces and appropriate amenities for guests are very important. Additionally, space on the dance floor and a well-functioning sound system are essential for everyone to fully enjoy the party.

Ultimately, price also plays a role in my opinion. A wedding is an important event, but I don't want to overpay. I expect fair and competitive prices that are adequate to the services offered and the quality of the place.

To summarize, a good wedding venue should create an unforgettable experience for all participants. Appropriate atmosphere, professional service, high-quality food and good facilities are the factors that influence my opinion. When these elements are well harmonized, I can confidently say that this place is worth considering for organizing a wedding.",1685686227,True

The Employees:  Delightful, professional, and efficient!

This is a charming restaurant with an exceptional staff providing exceptional food. We have dined here on at least six different trips to Lubin and have never been disappointed.

The restaurant is clean and refreshing.  The unique decor reveals charming relics from the days of earlier railroads and is brightened with charming wall paintings and decor.

There are two rooms with tables, one more formal than the other. Also available are private alcoves for couples and a larger private dining room for groups.

The menu is well balanced, the food from soups to dinner to dessert is exceptional, and the staff is extremely helpful and will always go out of their way to improve your experience.

Access to the restaurant is accessible from the service road, and parking space is adequate.

The mystery is the contrast between this exceptional restaurant and the abysmal hotel rooms offered upstairs.

**************************************************

The Hotel:  1/2 star because it is not a tent! Horrible!

THE GOOD:
•	Employees:  Delightful, professional, and as helpful as possible, given the deplorable condition of the rooms.

THE BAD:
•	The Health Authorities have failed to protect the public and shut it down!

•	The people who wrote positive reviews are possibly  comparing the hotel to their time in prison.

•	Heat: The antique Wall mounted Heat & air-conditioning units do not produce heat! It is unlikely, therefore, that they cool.

•	Stench? Yes, everything.

•	Beds? Nightmare!  Better if you sleep in your car.

•	The Apartment: Painful! You gain approximately 6 meters square and most of that is filled with a very uncomfortable sofa-bed.  One of the two doors to the balcony works. The other is too old and damaged to open. Cold air balances the street noise penetrating without pity.

•	The bathroom fixtures do not yet qualify as antiques.

The prices charged for a room are similar to the modern Hilton, the lovely Ibis, or the fantastic Piano Hotel.

ChIJ2ar4ihFXIkcRxLM3OsqYQAY,Robert S.,en,en,1,a year ago,"Big issue with this hotel is its spider infestation. In the evening and during the night, you can see these hanging on the building facade, in the hallways and in the rooms. Ranging from 1 cm to 4-5 cm. The hotel explanation was that it is near the river. These spiders are seen all over the town, so it is something linked to the area, not the river. The low level restaurant and the breakfast area are clean, so it is obvious that these are vacuumed regularly.
Upon entering my room, I had to get rid of 15 spiders. These are not venomous, but can leave ugly blemishes if you are unlucky to have one on you during sleep, in your clothes, shoes and so on. Rooms do not have AC and the only way to get fresh air is through the windows, which do not have any meshes to stop insects going into rooms. I had to leave my door opened to the hotel hallways and watch for anything that might crawl inside.
The personnel is friendly, rooms are not that clean, the in house beer is quite good and that`s about it. Spraying the local vegetation and the building facade, plus regular vacuuming of the nests and installing window meshes, will make a huge difference.

Ordered onion soup which was badly watered down and generally unimaginative in terms of flavor. Instead of croutons there was a thick peice of soggy bread in the middle of the soup - it didn't work.
Ordered a 29zl burger with duck and goat cheese. Dish was very dull, dry and simply unpalatable. Buns enclosing the salty cheese and duck were literally drenched in fat creating a gush of oil as the spongy bread was chewed and released it's excess in your mouth. The duck meat is best described as duck scraps that have been fried too long (or perhaps too often). There was no pickle to break up the blandness. I'm not sure what the chef was going for but it was not executed satisfactorily.
Out of desperation for something sour I requested ketchup (I known) but was told such a ramekin of precious condiment would cost 5 zl. At that point I gave up and only kept the dish long enough to snap a photo, hoping my bad experience would serve as a warning to others.
Fries were crispy, but had the bitter aftertaste of rancid oil.
My waitress noticed i had not eaten more than 1/3 of my dish and inquired what was wrong. Despite my detailed explanation and sending 2/3 back to the kitchen  I was given the bill with the full price of the dish included. No refund or placation was offered. I paid and left.

First of all, a wedding house that meets my expectations must have the right atmosphere. It is important that the place exudes coziness and elegance, creating an unforgettable atmosphere for guests and newlyweds. Aesthetic interiors, appropriate lighting and tasteful decoration are extremely important.

Another important factor is staff. Competent and friendly service influences the entire atmosphere of the event. Employees should be professional, discreet and ready to meet all needs and expectations. Good staff can really elevate the service and make it a special day for everyone in attendance.

Of course, one of the key aspects is the menu. As a lover of good food, I expect the wedding venue to provide high-quality food that is tasty and fresh. Menu variety is also important to meet the different tastes of guests. In addition, professional waiter service, which ensures that no one feels hungry or unserved, is extremely important.

Infrastructure is another aspect that I took into account when choosing a wedding venue. Large and spacious rooms, well-equipped toilets, comfortable parking spaces and appropriate amenities for guests are very important. Additionally, space on the dance floor and a well-functioning sound system are essential for everyone to fully enjoy the party.

Ultimately, price also plays a role in my opinion. A wedding is an important event, but I don't want to overpay. I expect fair and competitive prices that are adequate to the services offered and the quality of the place.

To summarize, a good wedding venue should create an unforgettable experience for all participants. Appropriate atmosphere, professional service, high-quality food and good facilities are the factors that influence my opinion. When these elements are well harmonized, I can confidently say that this place is worth considering for organizing a wedding.",1685686227,True

One of the highlights of our stay was the breakfast buffet. The selection of food was plentiful and delicious.

The location of the hotel was another positive aspect. Situated right in the center of town, we found it convenient to explore the surrounding area. We were able to easily access nearby shops, restaurants, and attractions, making our stay even more enjoyable.

However, one minor issue we encountered was the language barrier with the staff. Unfortunately, they did not speak much English, which made communication a bit challenging at times. Nevertheless, they were friendly and accommodating, doing their best to assist us despite the language barrier.

Despite this small drawback, our night at Willa West-Ende was peaceful and relaxing. The comfortable room, tasty breakfast, and convenient location made our stay pleasant overall.

The location of the hotel was another positive aspect. Situated right in the center of town, we found it convenient to explore the surrounding area. We were able to easily access nearby shops, restaurants, and attractions, making our stay even more enjoyable.

However, one minor issue we encountered was the language barrier with the staff. Unfortunately, they did not speak much English, which made communication a bit challenging at times. Nevertheless, they were friendly and accommodating, doing their best to assist us despite the language barrier.

Despite this small drawback, our night at Willa West-Ende was peaceful and relaxing. The comfortable room, tasty breakfast, and convenient location made our stay pleasant overall.

I felt safer here than I do staying elsewhere in and around the UK. The staff were very welcoming, warm and friendly and bilingual at the very least. I feel ashamed that I did not speak much Polish, which is something I would like to change. Someone was always on hand to welcome us back from our explorations and goodbye when we left to explore and meet up with extended family; as well as answering any enquiry we may have had. Each of our rooms were clean, comfortable with towels and toiletries provided in the ensuite shower and toilets. We had balconies with outdoor seating provided and spare seating in the room so you didn't feel like you had to stay or sit on the bed. None of our rooms felt cramped. Iron and ironing board on each floor for guest use. Mini bar provided in the room at extra charge as standard, wardrobe and writing desk with kettle, tea, coffee and bottled water provided. Room service was also available. There was a telescope on hand for some stargazing in the hallway to our floor. I wanted to bring the pillows off my bed home, they were soft and very comfortable. The city centre is literally a stones throw away with local convenience shops, pharmacies and various multiple dining options available. There was even a shopping gallery/mall easy to locate and walk to within fifteen minutes, but sadly was closed for the Easter weekend. I will be returning here for future trips as Bialystok has earned a firm place in my heart and having only stayed for the weekend I have only scratched the surface. The hotel also hosted a sit down function after my niece's Christening, which was also amazing, with balloons and unicorn soft plush to decorate, a well laid and decorated table with covered chairs. Plenty of toilet facilities on the ground floor, restaurant is on split levels, so if you have any mobility issues, then please mention this to staff.

I love a place like this…the complete opposite of soulless modern.  I arrived after midnight and the young man at the desk was patient and kind and beyond helpful after my long trip from Berlin.

The room is charming. I threw open the window to the balcony and slept through the night.  The hotel is on a side street to the main square so it is blissfully quiet while being at the center of everything.

The breakfast was amazing.  Truly.  The chef smokes and cures all his meats and makes all his pastries.  I am from the United States.  Who does this?  The breakfast is a beautiful adventure.  It will take two days to try everything.

The people who work here are lovely.  They smile.  They are kind and they would do anything to help you.  I speak no Polish and I am still at home here.

A man wrote a very negative review some months ago. I nearly didn’t come.  That hurts a place like this, so committed to superior service over decades.  I am writing this as a solo woman traveler.

The service at Pepper i Wanilia deserves special mention. The waitresses are always smiling, polite and professional. Their kindness and commitment to guest service make you feel special. Every question about the menu is met with a competent answer, and the dish recommendations are spot on.

The kitchen is the absolute gem of this place! The chefs ensure the highest quality of dishes, which are fresh, perfectly seasoned and beautifully presented. I especially recommend the homemade broth - it is the true taste of childhood, perfectly seasoned, as well as the pork chop, which is juicy, crispy and served with additions that perfectly complement the whole.

I felt safer here than I do staying elsewhere in and around the UK. The staff were very welcoming, warm and friendly and bilingual at the very least. I feel ashamed that I did not speak much Polish, which is something I would like to change. Someone was always on hand to welcome us back from our explorations and goodbye when we left to explore and meet up with extended family; as well as answering any enquiry we may have had. Each of our rooms were clean, comfortable with towels and toiletries provided in the ensuite shower and toilets. We had balconies with outdoor seating provided and spare seating in the room so you didn't feel like you had to stay or sit on the bed. None of our rooms felt cramped. Iron and ironing board on each floor for guest use. Mini bar provided in the room at extra charge as standard, wardrobe and writing desk with kettle, tea, coffee and bottled water provided. Room service was also available. There was a telescope on hand for some stargazing in the hallway to our floor. I wanted to bring the pillows off my bed home, they were soft and very comfortable. The city centre is literally a stones throw away with local convenience shops, pharmacies and various multiple dining options available. There was even a shopping gallery/mall easy to locate and walk to within fifteen minutes, but sadly was closed for the Easter weekend. I will be returning here for future trips as Bialystok has earned a firm place in my heart and having only stayed for the weekend I have only scratched the surface.

I love a place like this…the complete opposite of soulless modern.  I arrived after midnight and the young man at the desk was patient and kind and beyond helpful after my long trip from Berlin.

The room is charming. I threw open the window to the balcony and slept through the night.  The hotel is on a side street to the main square so it is blissfully quiet while being at the center of everything.

The breakfast was amazing.  Truly.  The chef smokes and cures all his meats and makes all his pastries.  I am from the United States.  Who does this?  The breakfast is a beautiful adventure.  It will take two days to try everything.

The people who work here are lovely.  They smile.  They are kind and they would do anything to help you.  I speak no Polish and I am still at home here.

A man wrote a very negative review some months ago. I nearly didn’t come.  That hurts a place like this, so committed to superior service over decades.  I am writing this as a solo woman traveler.

There is rest here.  There is quiet.  There is excellent food and kind service.

I hope this is representative of all of Poland because I will be overjoyed.

When placing the order, the waitress explained that there was a lot of traffic that day, but apart from ours, there were three tables occupied at that moment, and there were two waitresses. When she served us the dishes, it turned out that I received pasta with shrimp and I ordered it with chicken. I immediately noticed what I heard that the lady saw it while carrying it and was also surprised... I don't understand why she gave it to me at all when she saw that I was carrying the wrong orders. I had the impression that she didn't really want to do anything about it and wanted me to eat what I was given because she said she could go to the kitchen and ask what was going on. This was another moment when I wanted to leave, because honestly, I haven't encountered such incompetent service for a long time. When the lady from the kitchen came back, she told me that the kitchen had made a mistake and she could take away the pasta with shrimps and they would make it with chicken. We had already received the second course, so I decided it would be difficult to wait. After some time, I received pasta with chicken, but I was again disappointed because it turned out that pasta with chicken and wild mushrooms was actually pasta with chicken and mushrooms. I was very surprised by this, because other dishes that had sauce with mushrooms, e.g. potato pancakes, were written in the menu, and no one pulled the wool over wild mushrooms. When paying, it turned out that the receipt listed pasta with shrimp first and only then deducted and loaded with chicken, which makes me start to doubt whether the kitchen made a mistake or the waitress and blamed the kitchen.
