The food we ordered wasn‚Äôt so bad BUT here start what I didn‚Äôt like: the avocado and the vegetables that accompanied our main were not mature enough. The avocado was hard rock and the broccoli too. I just left a fork in it SO that maybe they would understand when getting the dish back‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt. When I told them about it they were sorry but nothing was done to remediate to my complain.
I can fairly say only half of the dish was eaten because clearly I couldn‚Äôt eat those hard (not mature) vegetables.
Service is attentive and polite.
The PRICE to be in wroclaw is out of target. All the food cost is high and something cost more than in luxury hotels in Italy and France, this to me is a nono also because I‚Äôve been hanging at main competitor 5 stars hotels restaurants and the price was around 30% cheaper.
Last ultra nono? They charge service. I was charged 10% service on a 450zl lunch with hard vegetables like we aren‚Äôt in wroclaw but in Saint Tropez, Mykonos or Miami.
Personally I always leave tip to the waiters if the service is good, charging a service charge was just pretentious as it‚Äôs not mandatory. (when the food is so so but u want to appear top).
I hardly doubt, not having found the food stunning and the right attention to customer issues that I would ever go back to have dinner there.

On our visit to Przysta≈Ñ tu we were not the most hungry so we decided to get something small. So we ordered a polish/European basic. Tartar. Along with that, we ordered fries (that in our opinion seemed out of place on their menu and so it was a kind of joke/test) and some bread came with the tartar.

The tartar that we received was salty, so salty that it was absolutely inedible and we had to send it back to the kitchen. After getting the new tartar that was completely different than the first that we received, it left us questioning the consistency of menu items. Not to mention the bread that we got with it seemed like something we could pick up in Biedronka. The tartar that we did eat was fine. I would even say quite up to standard and interesting. Though it was not super special and did not change our lives.

Now to the misplaced fries. In my opinion, a restaurant of this kind should not have fries on the menu. If you are going to have fries then they should at least be made in house. But finally if you must buy pre-made fries they should at least be properly cooked, crispy, and salted. If you haven‚Äôt already guessed from my long precursor their fries were none of the above. Sad.

So here is my legitimate question: If you can‚Äôt execute on the basics then why should we trust you with anything beyond that?

We were kindly given a desert for having sent the first tartar back to the kitchen. It was a cheesecake with raspberry ice cream. There was something like an Oreo crumb as well as 2 or 3 different berry ‚Äògels‚Äô (or reductions). Because we did not order it I will spare the details. The desert was an absolute mess.

I had a dinner for 2 people in this restaurant on 15/08, was public holiday but not so many guests at the time. We had a course of duck filet and tagine. The food were under expectation, let me tell you why:
- The duck filet was served cold and dry, as in the status of ‚Äúcongratulation‚Äù far beyond than well-done. It was over-cooked or being kept so long on heating up plate. So the meat was no longer pinky, juicy as it supposed to be, I guess this was the reason why we waited quite long.
- Grilled/stir-fried veggies were over-cooked as well with some peas were burned. As I have eaten some burned parts, it was too much bitter and smoked smell so I showed the waitress what was wrong with my order.
- My partner had tagine, shredded beef with chickpeas. He said it was ok, 7/10. Mediocre.
I had attached photos for preferences.
I started to read negative comments about this restaurant after my visits, and most of them were about long waiting time and attitude of waiter/waitress, unfortunately, it‚Äôs true in some ways.

Our table was so wobbly he couldn't be bothered to fix it (mind you there were only 3 tables occupied when we came). He was so inattentive, and scattered, he took my order wrong (I ordered beet salad and he gave me tomatoes) and didn't even bother to make it right (comp the item or a free dessert would have been nice). I said I would eat them since I didn't want to have food waste, but come on. I was done quite quickly and after at least 10 minutes of us just sitting there, he comes over and asks can they prepare the main dish. So all this time he could have asked how we were doing, but he didn't. I wasn't aware I was supposed to ask him to start cooking the next meal. We were so hungry I was ready to leave. The main dishes were pretty good, my pierogi were a bit dry (they could have used some type of sauce), but the schnitzel did have good flavor. We didn't bother getting dessert cause the service was just so slow.

1. Started with an oyster and Vodka and in all honestly, the oyster fantastic and vodka was a concoction of spice and alcohol - would be better off just having the oysters.

2. Moving onto our starters whereby we had snails, prawns, baby octopus and salmon tartare. Out of theses the snails were probably the best. The prawns were shocking, felt as though the fisherman went on their summer holidays and the staff had to go fishing for it themselves. Would not recommend for its price point.

Salmon tartare was average
Baby octopus the sauce was probably the best thing about it.

3. Mains:  we had pasta in black ink sauce, stuffed tortellini and steak. To my surprise the best thing was the steak! The stuffed tortellini was dry and barely tasteful. Pasta was average and I would recommend the steak overall.

Dessert was very forgettable and I am unable to recall it on writing this.

4. They have a nice selection of wine - no complaints.

5. Staff: helpful and friendly, however service was disjointed and we waited 30 mins for our dessert. Staff seemed to have little understanding about the dishes and unable to explain more about each dish when asked.

The starters were incredible! So tasty and we didn‚Äôt really know what to expect. We had the deer sausage and the goats cheese starters.

Onto mains, my partner had the duck leg which I tried and it was absolutely divine!
However, I ordered the chicken and it was very bland. Chicken was cooked beautifully but the sauce had no flavour and I couldn‚Äôt taste the truffle whatsoever, so it was a huge let down. I think it would have been much nicer with risotto instead of sunflower seeds.

Firstly I like to mention about Hospitality of restaurant. Guy who was in front (not know his name) kind of bad attitude and not professional service. I was struggling open the Main door and he looked at me inside ‚Äúis he dumb? Why he can not open door‚Äù. I own 2 restaurants in the state and if any guest was struggling open the door my service team or I will support my guest. start of this restaurant journey was terrible. However Our server lady with glasses was very friendly tho. She explained wine very friendly and detailed. However, I had keep issues with this guy server all night. We left 80% of foods and he took our plate without any questions. And we had couple conversations about restaurants in poznan. And I kind of told him I‚Äôm very surprised your restaurant got nominated ‚ÄúBibb gourmet‚Äù in Michelin guide. And he looked at me and laugh then disappeared with my check. I have more things about this guy but I‚Äôm going to talk about foods next

We ordered quite lots of food for 2 ppl. App was kind of ok compare to other Bibb gourmet restaurants I visited in Poland. My foie was burnt and set of foie dish was blend. Scallop was so blend with pure and other garnish. Prawn was also nothing impressed.

For entree, we ordered turbot, trout, pork. Turbot sauce was terrible. It was just beurre blanc sauce with big CHUNK of capers in it. Sauce doesn‚Äôt have any seasoning and any acid. Pork dish was ok. They cooked pork very unevenly and pepper and bean set was Iike normal bistro restaurant. Trout dish was worst. Looks like they put lots of effort in plating but can you guys please taste all the components before making menu. It was blend leek puree and some potatoes and broccolini.

Maybe my standard of food is too high for this restaurant but if they give us great hospitality I could just finish all the foods. That guy server took our food and he did not comment or question anything about how was our experience. If you are visiting from other countries just be aware, this is not gonna make your mind blow away. And hopefully that guy server can treat everyone same. I spent $240 USD tonight‚Äôs experience.

From the moment I stepped in, the ambience enveloped me in a warm and welcoming atmosphere. It struck the perfect balance, being neither too crowded nor too deserted, which added to the overall pleasant dining experience.

The food here deserves a special mention for its absolute deliciousness. Every dish we ordered was a testament to the chef's expertise, with flavors that were rich and perfectly balanced. The highlight for me was not just the taste, but also witnessing the culinary artistry firsthand. The open kitchen layout allowed us to watch the staff meticulously preparing our meals, which spoke volumes about their confidence in their cleanliness and skill.

Speaking of cleanliness, the restrooms were immaculate, echoing the old adage that clean toilets reflect a clean kitchen - a reassuring sign for any diner. This attention to detail extended to the service as well. The staff was exceptionally attentive and helpful, navigating the fine line between being present when needed and giving us our space, making us feel both valued and comfortable.

In summary, my experience at Cucina 88 was profoundly satisfying. The food, ambience, and service were all top-notch, executed with professionalism that made our visit memorable.

For those who don‚Äôt have time to read my full review, here is a summary - 5 stars from me. Great service, simple but pleasant interior, okay prices for wine and bottled beers plus great food. Please note that part of the menu appears to be changing from time to time.
Now for the actual story. The third time is a charm, as some people say... Every time we visited our hometown we wanted to eat at the restaurant Piwnica ≈Å√≥dzka but always something got in our way. This time the same scenario was about to occur and its creator would be time, or rather, the lack of it. However we were so desperate to dine there that we ran all our errands and ultimately spent 2 lovely hours at Piwnica ≈Å√≥dzka.
We were very hungry so decided to take more than what we normally would eat. We ordered two appetisers (but one of them was actually a main dish) and then we both had the main course. For that reason there was no place for dessert. First appetiser was dumplings with crayfish (they are not in their current menu anymore). This is one of the few appetisers that will remain in my memory for the rest of my life. They were wonderful, this sauce, this smell, this taste‚Ä¶ The second appetiser was a Polish classic beef tartare which could be done either amazingly or disastrously. Luckily this one was really flavourful and we both agreed that the famous tartare from the restaurant Stary Dom in Warsaw dropped down to second place after trying this one. Tartare is served here with all sides like pickled cucumber and onion separately so you can compose it just as you like.
After the appetisers I could have eaten dessert and would have been full :) but we wanted to try the main course. Paulina ordered knedle (dumplings) with plum with slow-cooked beef and young sweet cabbage. ATTENTION! At their English menu you‚Äôll see dumplings but don‚Äôt expect regular ‚Äúpierogi‚Äù as it is a different dish. There simply isn‚Äôt a better word to translate KNEDLE hence dumplings. Enter POLISH KNEDLE in google and you will see the difference. By the way, plum dumplings are a real delicacy and the combination of sweet plum with slow cooked meat and cabbage is a true perfection here. I had roasted pork ribs, potato croquette stuffed with spinach and grana padano cheese plus coleslaw. My ribs were as good as my fianc√©e's beef. Perfectly seasoned, perfectly baked and the sauce was very tasty. The only drawback - too much for us :) Alf with his seven stomachs was missing to consume that feast :)
The prices here are similar to those in any good Polish restaurant.

Located amongst a couple of my favourite places to eat in Lodz, I thought I'd give Asiart a try on a Saturday evening. The place was not very full on a weekend day, which should have been my first warning, but I put that down to the rainy weather. The decor was drab and more suited to a fast food joint than a dine-in restaurant. Nevertheless, me and my family settled in and placed a very minimal order, just to get a gist of the flavours - two sushi dishes and one noodle main course. To our shock and dismay, the sushi took a whopping 45 minutes to arrive. The kids, who weren't that hungry in the beginning, got super hungry and started to kick up a fuss. To make matters worse, the noodle main took another whole 45 minutes still! As mentioned, it wasn't like the place was full or anything - there were 4 or 5 tables other than us, barely a third the capacity of the restaurant. I dread to think what would have happened if the place was actually at capacity. To top off the nightmare experience, our server looked stressed, overworked, and seemed to have forgotten about our side of the restaurant for most of the evening. Af over an hour of waiting for the single main course we ordered, we chased up about it and we're told ""a few minutes"" which, if you have irritated children sitting with you for an hour, doesn't provide any consolation. Another 10-12 minutes passed and we had to follow up another time, only to be told another 5 minutes. Another 10-12 minutes later, the food did arrive, and it was the most disappointed I have ever been with a noodle dish. The taste was very average and not at all something I would wait an hour and a half for (or even 45 minutes for). The sushi itself was also extremely disappointing, as the rice had been overcooked, as had the grilled salmon in one of the sushi dishes. What's more, after such a delay we would have expected at least an apology from the chef or waitress, but none was forthcoming.  The waitress could also have followed up with the timing herself when she saw two kids getting more and more irritated as the food took disproportionately long to arrive, but I said before, she seemed too stressed out and too busy with the other side of the restaurant to really care about our table that much. Overall, a super disappointing outcome to our evening and to our taste buds and I would not recommend this place over the other, much better restaurants in the same area (try ukryte rzeki or tutti santi rather than Asiart) and if you feel like sushi, it'll be quicker for you to go home, order a takeaway, have it delivered, and even finish eating than to be waiting at this restaurant for service.",1706460778,False

This one is undoubtedly the best of them. The zone has a disenchanted interior, cozy yet modern, I especially like the installation with Tanka Tyskie. We were assigned a cozy and comfortable seat, and since we went during Restaurant Week, we were not given a menu. I would describe the pace of service as average, no dishes were served from a machine, but we didn't have to wait long enough to feel nervous. The waitress serving us was polite and presented the dishes in a casual manner.

One star is deducted for the vegetarian menu, with particular mention of the watermelon steak. Unfortunately, this dish is simply not good, the watermelon is too soft after processing, and it tastes strange when combined with spices. However, the starters are ok. The dessert from the vegetarian menu is ok, but the starter is a matter of taste.

Delicious meat menu! From appetizer to dessert. The dumpling stuffed with meat was equally good (not on the Restaurant Week menu, ordered separately). In my opinion, a restaurant should focus on classic dishes with a slight twist, leave aside the variants such as watermelon steak and success is guaranteed.

Most of the guests of the place during our evening went to Strefa to have a beer/drink - which is a pity. The menu is extensive, there is also a breakfast menu.

We will definitely come back, we have already planned our next dishes :)",1729935053,True

But my experience of today, I felt insulted and cheated completely as a customer. Firstly I didn't felt it as Malai kofta, which was earlier used to be filled with cheese and cashew nuts (even mentioned in menu details). Secondly today I was alone so there was no one to ask you if everything is okay with food or not, you have to go your own to find someone to ask you. They don't care if you are alone customer or only few. They will take care only if it's well crowded. This happens when the rating goes higher and when you becomes a brand value.

Each bite was a delightful mix of crunch and smoothness, seasoned to perfection with a harmonious blend of spices that accentuated the natural flavors of the potato.

My friend opted for the Crispy Pork Loin accompanied by potatoes. This dish was a testament to the kitchen's skill in balancing flavors and textures. The pork loin was cooked to a succulent crispiness, enveloping a tender, juicy interior. Paired with well-seasoned, fluffy potatoes, it created a satisfying, hearty meal that left us both impressed.

The service at Restauracja Zaklƒôty Czardasz was equally commendable. The staff was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, making our dining experience smooth and enjoyable. They were quick to offer suggestions and ensure that all our needs were met promptly.

ChIJuZ9Fh2hXIkcReyFc_RFbLes,Malgorzata Brewinska,en,en,2,5 months ago,"Really a big disappointment. The restaurant ‚ÄúKardamon‚Äù wants to brand themselves as fine dining place. Unfortunately it‚Äôs quite far from that aim. Water is served in the cheapest IKEA jug. Food is mediocre. The menu available on the website is different from the one presented to the guests in the restaurant. Is the update of the website so hard and time consuming? Really? Further, the cauliflower steak was over salted and mediocre. Definitely not worth the price. The tagliatelle with mashroom sauce did not include any fresh mashrooms. The mashrooms used came from a jar. Quite a low quality for a place wanting to present themselves as sophisticated. Unfortunately the pork tenderloin was served with green beans instead of asparagus as noted in the menu. We‚Äôre in the middle of the asparagus season now. So why? Why would you make such a substitution now?
However, something that was the cherry on the top of this disappointing visit was shattered glass on the table cloth. That‚Äôs dangerous and irresponsible. If something was broken earlier on this table cloth, it should be taken away and replaced.
Tiramisu had no taste of coffee. It was served in a lovely way though.
Another thing is the tap in the bathroom. It could use a replacement.

Now to the food. Beef tartare was one of the best I've tried, and I've tried a lot. The service is also brilliant. Cannelloni were delicious, a perfect taste. Bourguignon was well cooked and soft, we loved the hot, probably horseradish, finish on top. The fish was pretty tasty and originally served, but very disappointing because of a lot of bones inside, though we were assured that fish fillets are served boneless.

The desserts. We tried ice cream: flavours are very surprising, you just don't expect an ice cream with the taste of hay or asparagus. But it was delicious, really.

Overall, it's an amazing place, decorated and furnished on a great level. Food is more than delicious. Prices are pretty okay, I can't call this place expensive, compared to the food they serve. Parking at the restaurant might be tough, but c'mon, taking a 100-200m walk is worth the experience.

During this time, several waitstaff passed by, attending to larger tables while ignoring us entirely. It felt as though we were an afterthought, which left us feeling unwelcome.

When our food finally arrived, it was disappointing to find it served cold. The fries, in particular, seemed stale, as if they had been sitting out for some time. This was surprising, given how quickly the order arrived after we finally managed to place it.

A word of caution: if you order a liter of any beverage, be sure to ask for it without ice, or you'll end up with a jug of flavored water. While the food presentation was appealing, the taste didn't live up to expectations, and the temperature of the dishes only added to the dissatisfaction.

In summary, while the restaurant scores high on aesthetics, the service left us feeling overlooked and undervalued. The food, though beautifully presented, failed to impress‚Äîespecially when served cold. If you value good service and warm, fresh food, this might not be the best choice.",1725171843,False

I am Thai and as a Thai living in Poland. I miss Thai Food a Lot!
I have to say This is not the best place for Thai food in Lublin.
I have been to this place a couple of times and many times I was not as happy as I would‚Äôve like to be after visiting a Thai restaurant.
For people who work in a Thai restaurant it was very weird they did not know what ‚ÄúPrick Nam Pla‚Äù was even though it was served with some Menu‚Äôs. I asked for it and 3 times they brought the wrong thing even though I showed them pictures.

Last time I was there I ordered one dish but got 2 dishes
(One of them that I didn‚Äôt order) after I told the lady who served it that I didn‚Äôt order it she didn‚Äôt take it back nor apologized but she just said ‚Äúwe already made it‚Äùin a tone I was not really happy to hear like it was my fault and walked away‚Ä¶
And So surprise surprise.. of course I had food left over and I ask to put them in a box. They charged me 7 zl for the box and bag‚Ä¶.
I ended up paying so much for a meal I did not order and the boxes to take it home‚Ä¶

I will not be going back for a while.
That was one of the worst experiences ever.
I didn‚Äôt give them 1 star because I guess it depends on the day what type of service you get but the Food is still decent and good

The 2 stars are all taken away because of the service.

However, If you decide to go there
I do recommend:
- Red Curry Chicken
- Pad Kra Pow
- Kai Pad Med Ma Muang

And Thai lemon tea

Long review:
We came in the restaurant with high hopes that we would eat tasty cuisine and addequate quality which is on par with the prices, unfortunetly what we got was at best ok dishes with rude behavior in the end.

As shown in the pictures these are the dishes we order for 3 people  to share +2 drinks.

Lamb: cooked good but it was missing spices and it was really ‚Äúbland‚Äù, the decoration and the sauces it came with werent really fitting

Scotish salmon: nice dish and fresh salmon, could use more acidity but overall good plate and presentation.

Beef Tartar: nothing special, was missing allot of spices like pepper/salt, i have eaten much better beef tartar in much cheaper place which is disappointing.

Foie gras: good quality and taste, the sauce accompanied was nothing special, average dish for 100zl

Tomahwak steak(The big problem): the steak came as medium rare which as in the photo it seems to be accurate, but unfortunetly texture wise and taste wise was a huge disappointment for what you are paying.
The pieces were hard to cut even with the steak knife and ofcourse it was hard to chew as well, we kindly asked them to check if this was properly made, what we got in result afterwards was a very unprofessional handling of the situation.
First they told us the excuse that tomahawk is a ‚Äúhard‚Äù meat and its chewy which is laughable and wrong excuse, they continued later saying that you must cook it longer to be softer and that chef said it was perfect and that the other tomahawks they prepared that day were ok(completly irrelevant?)
Afterwards they told us that its our fault we dont like it and that the steak is on par with the restaurants standar.
After all these excuses we had lost our appetite and we kindly asked to just remove it from the bill as we didnt even eat it other than trying 2 pieces out of the whole tomahawk steak, they refused to remove from the bill even thought they took the plate back and kept saying basically with kinder words that all 3 of us dont know how to eat! Funny cause chewy and hard meat is noones standard of eating especially from such an establishment.

Overall the flavors and behavior of the staff and management on a negative feedback was terrible and ruined our last night in the city.

The place might have been worth a 3ish star rating untill the tomahawk ,but after all that behavior which was a huge red flag of unprofessionalism its a hard 1.

Overall 800zl wasted on tasteless food which should be much better to be on par with prices they ask.
not recommended at all!",1676760668,False
ChIJf4rqByATA0cRXuQGAckYK2A,Drag Eoner,en,en,1,a year ago,"In short: Thank you, next. Bad and rude service, tasteless and bad quality of food. They think techniques matter more than taste and it is expensive for nothing. Their response ""This is our standards"". Well, your standards are pretty low for this amount of money you ask.

Overal experience: 1 star
I chose this restaurant due to the nice reviews, and I was hoping to eat something nice and extraordinary. But in the end, the only extraordinary thing is how bad the experience was.

Place: 4 stars
The place is nice, cosy and pretty good decoration.

Food: 1 star
They welcomed us with few tiny parmesan pies with fresh chives, which were nice. After that, they provided some nice warm bread, but the butter, which was accompanying it was mediocre. The butter with herbs could be better.

Beef tartare with mayo, parsley and pickled mushroom was mediocre. The texture was nice, but it was missing salt and the pickled mushroom did not provide anything than it usually does.  I have eaten better beef tartare in cafeterias and hookah cafes which is NOT of course their main service food.

Foie gras was nice, juicy and melting like butter.

Marinated Scottish salmon was ok. It had some nice acidity, but I was expecting it to be more juicy, with refreshing tones. However, I found fennel too much and hiding the flavour of salmon.

Lamb saddle was weird. Cooking was perfect as it should be. Juicy, tender and soft. However, the combinations of the sides were really weird. Cherry and plum jam was not helping at all. Lamb was missing salt, pepper, thyme/rosemary, lemon - ingredients that help the meat to be distinctive. I am not criticising the whole idea, but it was not working as it should.

Last but not least, Tomahawk steak was the worst I have ever eaten. The cooking technique was good as I ordered for medium-rare. However, the quality of the meat was really bad. It was ultra chewy and I could not cut it in pieces. Also, this meat was missing salt too. I complained about this dish and returned it immediately with all its pieces back to the plate. The final result was the management of the restaurant refusing to accept their fault and provide us a discount or remove its price from the bill.

***The BEST part starts now !***
Service's response was that it was my fault that I ordered it medium-rare and that's why it was chewy. BUT a few minutes later they came back and presented another story that they tried the steak it was very fine and it was according to their standards, soft and tender. Some minutes later, another waiter comes with another story and says that this piece of meat is always chewy and how IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE !!!! So they were not prepared to explain their nice fairy tale, each story was cancelling the previous one and they did NOT WANT to apologise and take responsibility.

Tomahawk Steak is expensive because it's a very high quality, tender, juicy and large cut of Prime beef taken from the rib section of the cow. This meat was NOTHING but a piece of dry wood.

The reason I refused to have another steak or something similar is because the service from the start was rude and arrogant, behaving that they never do a mistake and did not want to acknowledge that their service in reality was cheap, poor and needed improvements. The first thing that they said was ""it's your fault"". Let me tell you that I always eat medium-rare meat and I would not even dare to feed my dog with this bad quality of meat they offered.

Service: 1 star for all the above reasons.

There are far better places to visit in Bydgoszcz. Thank you, next.",1676764950,False

While tiny, the interior is cute and I appreciated the chill environment. Nothing super fancy here; what you see is what you get and I dig it. 'Cause I dig shrimp. Ordered a 5 piece shrimp tempura plate as an app and was not disappointed. Tempura was super light and crispy. Shrimp was tender and juicy. Hello, sweet potato fries? Amazing! Well seasoned, sweet, salty, crunchy, delicious. The corn piece could have been bigger, warmer, and come with some plain butter (but that's just the American in me). Homemade garlic butter complimented the baguette well. Loved the garlic aioli sauce, could have done with a lot more of that. My boyfriend got the bacon shrimp burger and miraculously let me have a bite. I'm glad I took a big one 'cause ohemgee, who would have thought that bacon and fried shrimp would pair well together? It does, and the kimchi is such a delightful bonus. Finally, we shared the white wine shrimp for a main dish. I was sopping up pieces of bread in that sauce with a quickness. I could low key drink it out of the pan it was so good. The shrimp was very well cooked. Nevermind that we both reeked of garlic for the rest of the night, but that's the price you have to pay people. Also appreciated the friendly and helpful staff who spoke English and offered us menus in English as well.

A few suggestions from a humble international foodie: I would add a mix of tempura and grilled shrimp as an appetizer so people can get the best of both worlds. I would add a classic shrimp alfredo as there are several dishes with red sauces but did not see any with a cream sauce. I think cornbread (with butter and/or honey) would do really well here. And, I would also add a few options for dessert (breading pudding for example).

Tried this place 4 or five times since. Every time it changed a notch, from bad to worse... Not worth the time AND the money. ANY fast food joint beats the place! And believe me... I am not a fast food lover by ANY means.

We visited this restaurant just one time so far, so we will update this review ""as we go"":

It is located out of the beaten path, but very close to the center, in a new ""mixes use"" building with VERY limited parking. The restaurant itself is guarded by the heaviest door we ever encountered in any restaurant we visited so far, and there are many. We actually thought it was closed, and we have not been the only customers which had that problem. During our visit we observed 3 groups of visitors unsuccessfully trying to open the door. I helped two of them, by pushing it from inside...
Service is quick and knowledgeable. Unfortunately for us, Chinese and/or Thai beer on the menu was not available that day, same with dishes which included tofu and/or wontons. And that was a problem for us. Well...we settled on ""spring rolls"" and Heineken.
Beer was cold and so were the rolls. Furthermore, the filling of the rolls was not what we expected. It was rather pasty and dense, not bad in taste, but rather similar in appearance and texture to the ones one buys in frozen food isle.
Calamari tasted fresh and good. Dipping sauce, which seems to be a generic mixture served with everything I observed on other tables, had nothing to do with the calamari, nor could it (in my opinion) be paired with any other fried seafood. Not sure actually...it was a dipping mixture, which I never encountered in any NATIVE Chinese restaurants, or any other Chinese restaurant somewhere else before . But I will definitely try to get use to it, for the sake of good calamari! Chicken dish was fresh and tasty and the rice was fluffy and done right.

Our only suggestion is to introduce some partitions between tables for a bit more of privacy.
But the colour of the walls, the decorations and the piano make it rather irresistible.
Now to the waiting service. We've visited twice and twice it was impeccable.
The first time it wasn't busy and the waitress paid us a lot of attention, telling us about the history of the place, explaining that they're selling great polish liquors by Baczewski and taking pride in offering typical Polish dishes. She was equally nice to all the customers finding something to talk about to all of them. The second time it was much later, they were very busy yet the waiter was super polite and efficient.
The food was great, there is nothing else to be said. Selection is nice, not too little not too much. Menu offers something for vegetarians and children and those looking for the excellency of Polish cuisine. We had beetroot soup with small dumplings and kuyavian sour soup (both times!) Then a pig leg with cooked sour cabbage first time and pork tenderloin on potato pancakes the second, and pike perch with soft noodles. It was absolutely divine.
We flushed it down with mulled ginger beer, mulled honey and house wine. All worth to be recommended. We've also tried the tasting set from Baczewski. But it wasn't to our taste, more like vodka than a sweet liquor. However, I'm sure it's worth to try it to get your own opinion.

The offered compositions are very safe, there are no interesting, more unusual flavor combinations. We tried the carbonara and burrata. The first one should probably be called scrambled eggs, because it resembles a completely cooked egg with bacon. The tomato sauce at the bottom is not one of the ingredients of traditional carbonara, I don't understand why it is included in this composition. The burrata was better, although it is nothing surprising, and those 4 sad basil leaves look poor. However, the dough was amazing, not burnt, which was a plus. I was surprised by the fact that none of the pizzas had nduja or Italian mortadella, although they were listed in the additional paid ingredients (they were crossed out, if they are no longer on offer at all, it's a shot in the arm). You can feel that the ingredients used are of very good quality, but it is not at the level of AVPN-certified pizza, there are already such pizzas in Zamo≈õƒá, even without the certificate ;) The garlic olive oil was delicious, but the fact that you have to pay extra for it is absurd. The times of paid olive oil in restaurants are over, bottles should be on every table or at least at the cash register. Going further - the selection of drinks is poor, the drinks are the most typical possible, yet very tasty and refreshing. The wine from the barrel is worth mentioning, it is very delicate and does not disturb the taste of the pizza.
Being under the umbrellas, you don't feel the Italian atmosphere at all, even though we are sitting in the heart of the old market square designed by the Italian architect Bernardo Morando. The decor outside does not refer to anything, there are nasty oilcloths on the tables straight from the Polish People's Republic. Italian music should be playing from the speakers, not Polish radio.
The service saves the situation, we got a very nice waiter, kudos to you! His friend waited quite a long time to bring the menu to the table and it was faster to take it yourself, fortunately, serving the dishes did not take that much time.
From a technical point of view - the menu card could be much nicer graphically. It's a pity that there is only a knife for cutting pizza, scissors would be better. The price information (PLN 40 instead of PLN 40) is strange, considering that the menu is entirely in Polish, it would make sense if it was also in English. Another linguistic gaffe - salami spianata piccante or spicy? It would be worth correcting this, because both versions are available in the menu.
Was it bad? NO! Although this review focuses on the minuses, in general the pizza is really delicious and affordable, and that's what this restaurant is mainly about :) However, I think that the AVPN certificate obliges you to something more than just delicious pizza, there are many other small things to improve.",1722075809,True

Food - the waiting time may be a bit too long, but the delicious broth compensated perfectly. Pizza - toasted in a real oven - which was felt on the tongue.
Burger with chips - half and half experience - hence the 4-star rating.

Food: 2/5
Service: 1/5

Food by weight - a great idea. We took 2 pieces of pizza, a chicken leg, a couple of fries and some experimental pasta to try. The lady says PLN 90,58;) A bit much, but okay, it's hard, at least it will be good and the service will be nice...

Service - a total failure: I gave him a banknote of PLN 200 and I got back PLN 98 including groszy. I say - something is missing here. The lady counts... and counts... and says that she agrees that we are trying to cheat her ;) I say, ""but if the bill says PLN 90 and I give PLN 200, I should get over a hundred, right?"" The lady thinks and thinks and calls her boss. The boss at the entrance shouts loudly that how dare I say everything is OK, and starts explaining that it's impossible. The ladies took their phones, counted on a calculator, and shouted at each other. At some point, the first lady realized that it was a failure and reached for PLN 10 and said ""you're right"". The ""boss"" replied: no, what are you doing, you're stupid, what are you giving, it's wrong... After a good 8 minutes of calculations, I realized that I was owed PLN 109 plus pennies change, the boss paid extra. To relieve myself, I say - maybe a free ice cream for the kids for my stress... and the ""boss"" immediately says in bold, a bit Polish, a bit foreign, that I want to rob them and some similar insults. As I leave, I say that I probably won't eat there again - ""I don't care,"" the boss replies ;)

Well, great service.

Just the food - until I took photos. Chicken burnt and dry. Potatoes look like rubber. This experimental pasta is a disaster with lemons (I'm open to different flavors - it really didn't make sense). The fries seemed to be soaked in oil so they would cook more?

Located in the centre of Zielona Gora ""LA GONDOLA"" is an excellent place to spend your time;

They have an indoor and outdoor seating spaces. I would definitely recommend seating inside, which gives you the impression that you are in an Italian Gondola. The ambience is very Italian.

It is always busy especially during the evening, so if you are going in a large group it is advisable to book in advance.
The staff is super friendly and fast. The menus are in Polish and English (if requested);

The food (pizza, pasta, risotto, salads, desserts) is delicious. From Salads I highly recommend the one with Smoked Salmon (if you like fish), La Gondola (with chicken) or Greek Salad (if you are more into salads without meat/fish) - all salads are accompanied with two slices of bread with herbs and spices.

If you order a large pizza, you can order it in two different halves, which gives you a chance to taste various flavours. BEAR IN MIND THAT THEIR PEPPERONI COMES WITH JALAPENO AND IS QUITE SPICY. You are also given additional sauces: chilli sauce, garlic sauce to add it to pizza in case you want it.

The drinks do not come with ice (which is super perfect, because as a mom, I do not have to worry about my little one drinking something cold and getting a sore throat) but ice is provided upon request in a separate cup.

If you are more into pastas or risottos they both are amazing and the amount of chicken and sun-dried cherry tomatoes in the chicken Tagliatelle is super cool. I would even reduce that and add more pasta to the dish.

So if you are in the mood of spending an Italian Evening with family or friends definitely try ""La GONDOLA"" üíö

I‚Äôve never experienced an Indian restaurant which would serve badly tasting rice. Here was my first-of-a-kind experience. It was over cooked and off putting, and lacked taste

Our group ordered three different dishes, so arguably we had a limited selection which may be insufficient to formulate a general assessment. Nevertheless, not a single one of these dishes was acceptable

Sauces were sugary, greasy, and generally made an impression of low quality and low effort. They resembled cream with low amount of spices and some thin color, with lots of sugar added. It was a striking contrast to the rich sauces typically served in high quality restaurants, which are full of tomatoes, veggies and spices

However, the most disgusting thing was the meat. All dishes were with chicken and in all cases it was plainly awful

My typical experience is that good quality Indian restaurants serve chicken breast as their meat ingredient. And so, I was expecting the sauce to be full of neatly cut chicken breast pieces. Not here. What we got were some meat scraps cut off wings or legs, including ligaments and other less pleasant parts

Good quality handmade food!

Second visit to Handmade and was very nice once again, had a 50/50 Pizza, a good pizza with fresh ingredients. I personally enjoy a more tender crust on my pizza, and I find that it's especially delightful when it's prepared in a stone oven - however I have no complaints here. It was still very tasty and I happily ate everything!

Good selection of local beers, having lived in Ireland for many years, I had to try the local Olsztyn take on the Irish beer. Glad to sat I would definitely recommend it!  Similar to a Guinness / Beamish with its own unique flavour, very nice!

Waitress was lovely, she was new but did a fantastic job of tackling our 8 person order and understood my terrible Polish.

From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere felt off. Instead of the usual cozy music you expect in a restaurant, there was a loud radio playing Polish ads, which really killed the vibe. I even asked the server to lower the volume, but nothing changed.

Another disappointment was the seating. We were given plastic chairs that felt like cheap outdoor furniture‚Äîunstable and uncomfortable, which didn‚Äôt help me enjoy the meal.

Speaking of the meal, it was just okay. We ordered wine, but the server didn‚Äôt pour it at the table, so I‚Äôm not even sure we got the right one. Proper service would include pouring the wine in front of the guests and offering a glass of water, which wasn‚Äôt done. When we finally asked for water (which came at an extra charge), we were given just one glass to share throughout the entire meal.

As for the food itself, there was an issue with portioning the sauces. If you're going to serve dishes like potatoes or fried calamari, there should be enough sauce to last through the meal, but I ran out halfway through.

Overall, this experience wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting. In fact, it felt more like something out of Kitchen Nightmares.",1727971976,False

He just said ""he doesn't know,"" so we ordered carbonara and pizza from the menu.

We had purchased a package at the Bie≈Ñkowski resort with a romantic dinner. After prior instructions from the lady at the hotel reception, we made a reservation which, as it turned out, had disappeared and was not in the restaurant's system. Here, the waitress responded relatively quickly and assigned us a table. And this was the only good behavior of the staff in this restaurant. We stayed with the cards for about 15 minutes. After we asked to take our order, we waited another 5 minutes before the waitress came to us. After taking the order, we waited 15 minutes for the appetizers and over 30 minutes for the drinks. I would like to mention that other tables were accepted at that time and their drinks and food had long been served. The waiting time for the soups was a staggering 45 minutes. And beware, the broth came cold. We received the second courses after 70 minutes. The mashed potatoes were potatoes in chunks. I didn't even pay attention anymore because I had no strength left. After almost 2 hours in the restaurant, we gave up on desserts. We wanted to leave the restaurant and asked if the bill would be settled with our room, as was said at the reception. Of course, after such a long time, the waitress still didn't know how to settle our table, so we waited another 5 minutes for another waiter to close the bill. A mockery and a huge disappointment.

I don't understand how guests are treated this way. Your packages don't cost much, and the service in the restaurant is at an embarrassing level. Dinner, which was supposed to be spent in a nice place, was a very long wait and a great disappointment.

The mushroom soup is quite good, it would be much better in a warm form.

First of all, I LOVED the website with such elegant way of making a reservation. Hassle free with confirmation booking for the reservation just makes it easier to know that your reservation has been confirmed for your occasion. More importantly, the team taking time to generate the reservation number and send a conversation email does put a personal touch.

I did worry that what if the place does not look like the ones in the pictures online, but wow, from the entry, I was actually quite surprised how beautiful the entrance was. Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to ask our lovely waiter's name, but honestly, the whole staff was very lovely.

Most importantly, you a restaurant is all about the food. We have ordered different types of appetizers and main dishes, and wow, I was actually blown away at how fresh and lovely every food tasted.

1. Thai soup with coconut milk, curry, coriander and lots of lime and carrot - a very interesting combination of flavors. It's worth trying this intensely lime soup with a bit of spice. The advantage is that the soup from the lunch offer was large and could satisfy many people.
2. Amakara tori: breaded chicken, sweet and sour sauce, rice and sesame. The soup was good, but the chicken with sauce was so delicious you could eat it over and over again. The great combination of different textures: the juiciness of the chicken, the crispy breading and the sticky sauce made the dish complete.
3. And last: gyoza with duck, vegetables and orange sauce. The dumplings were delicious, but the orange sauce was the best. If it was possible to fall in love with food, I would definitely choose Gyoza.

When it comes to service and atmosphere: top-notch service. Professional and friendly. The atmosphere is completely different, and the mezzanine above the kitchen allows you to look behind the scenes of the kitchen and thus see some culinary magic.

Small self-service restaurant near downtown. Cheerful staff. To my great pleasure, one of the girls spoke decent English (which is not often in Poland), so we were able to order a meal and a drink without too much difficulty, with the recommendations of a friendly hostess. Although they didn't have an English menu so we used the pictures on Trip Advisor and Google to order food and drinks. We were at the restaurant on Friday around 5 pm and there were only a couple of guests so we got our food very quickly. I ate a pork chop coated with breadcrumbs with a mixture of cheese and mushrooms, baked potatoes and a serving of salad (three types). Everything was delicious. The home-brewed beer was Zywiec. A local beer that is surprisingly not too sweet. My friends were also pleased with the food. They ordered a tomato soup that evan a 4 year old child wanted to eat, various salads, fried meat with french fries and some pork stew that was sweet (pork rost in souce) and a children's menu. The restaurant is very clean and tidy as is the toilet. Staff cordial, smiling and welcoming. Bonus is a kid's corner (of great help because our little companion had fun and we a couple of minutes of rest). Mostly we were all happy with everything. We paid with the card. Lastly, I have to emphasize the price, very reasonably priced in terms of location and quality.

Ja sam jeo pohanu svinjetinu zalivenu mje≈°avinom sira i ≈°ampinjona, peƒçene krumpire i porciju salate (tri vrste). Sve je bilo jako ukusno. Domaƒçe toƒçeno pivo je bilo Zywiec. Lokalno pitko pivo koje zaƒçudo nije previ≈°e slatko. I moji prijatelji su bili zadovoljni sa jelom. Naruƒçili su juhu od paradajza koju je i dijete od 4 godine htjelo jesti, razne salate, pohano meso sa pomfritom i nekakav svinjski gula≈° koji je bio presladak (pork rost in souce) te djeƒçji meni.

The burger was generally ok, but the meat was slightly undercooked inside (I hope there will be no salmonella üòÅ) and the bacon was undercooked, as it wasn't crispy at all. On the plus side: it was really big and hot.

Unfortunately, my fries were dripping with grease (I know they're a fried dish, but you can really put them in a box without pouring oil), and instead of jalapeno there were chili peppers. I should receive this information after placing the order. Fortunately, it was chili, so there wouldn't be anything wrong with it, if it weren't for the fact that someone probably didn't want to cut it into smaller pieces, because the peppers were cut into large pieces.

To sum up: the food has potential, but raw meat is unacceptable, and someone who cooks obviously doesn't feel like it sometimes. Deep-fried, sliced, etc. No one will probably want to comment on the delivery. People don't know about peppers, it doesn't matter whether we use chili or jalapeno. Well, maybe so, but sometimes you come across someone who can distinguish chili from pepperoni, jalapeno or carolina. The advantage is fast delivery and hot dishes.

Last year,we were very impressed with the selection of sushi, which were made to perfection. Today, we decided to try other entrees. First, we ordered a coconut shrimp appetizer from the specials menu. Although it was properly made, it lacked flavor. For entrees,we ordered California rolls, which were great; the kids' chicken tenders with french fries were pretty good. Now, ginger beef entree was very spicy,even though it's marked as a level 1 spicy meal on the menu. My mom could barely handle it. I ordered a tofu/veggie curry that seemed to be made with regular cream instead of coconut milk/cream, and it was garnished with dill, which is very unusual in the Asian cuisine. I'd rather expect lemongrass or even scallions as garnish,not dill. Overall, the veggies were tasty,but there was barely any curry in the sauce even though I ordered a spicy option. Anyway, I think it's a hit or miss with the menu at Czarny Sezam. The decor of the restaurant is indeed beautiful,but the management should fix the ventilation and the exhaust vents inside the kitchen as one can see and smell the haze coming from the kitchen. Surely, all wardrobe needs to be washed after dining at Czarny Sezam; hence,it's probably better to enjoy and dine in their outdoor patio, which is not only very pretty but also well-ventilated.",1686425369,False

From the very beginning something didn't work and there were a lot of mistakes. First of all, a comment about the place, which is quite small and has major problems with ventilation, which causes the clothes to smell strongly of food. There is also no toilet on site, which I think is quite important information for subsequent guests. The waiting time was quite long but we were informed about it, so I forgive it. However, I will not remain indifferent to the significant shortcomings in the menu. BBQ mayo sauce - none has run out. French fries - gone. Not all burgers available - because something is missing. You had to adapt your decision to what is happening. I understand it's Sunday, but these are the basic products of a burger restaurant. There must always be fries.
There were serious order errors and there were only 5 of us on site. 4 burgers served and everyone ordered them, then finding out whether we actually ordered them or not. The owner eventually apologized and gave his friend an additional amount of meat at no extra charge. The tea was ordered black and delivered fruity.
Moving on to the food itself: the burger looked inviting, the quality of the beef and the degree of doneness were very good, but the seasoning should have been better. The flavor of the meat was lost under the additions, which made the whole sandwich very bland. I also tried another burger from my partner and the problem was identical.
The portion size was satisfactory, but that's all - it could have been better for the price. Ultimately, it wasn't the best burger I've ever eaten, nor in Tarn√≥w.

Anyway, the restaurant is indeed beautiful as it's decorated in the art deco style. We received a great service from our server, and she also offered us helpful suggestions when it comes to the menu options. The food arrived at different times, and this aspect could use some improvement. However, everything we got was excellent. The duck, the vege burger, the hummus, and the kids' meals were all really good. The vibe of the place is unique. With that being said, I think the decor is more appropriate for adults, especially the restrooms' decor. The mens' bathroom shocked my sons as there were images of nude men. Next time, I'd definitely send my kids to the women's bathroom to avoid some uncomfortable conversations afterward. Still, Aurora is worth a trip!",1687455212,False

For now, I give it 4 stars for something that is very important for such a large kebab: even distribution of meat, salad and sauce. Of course, along the longer kebab line. This was missing here.  On one side and then at the bottom there is salad and on the right there is 2/3 of dry meat without salad and without sauce.  At the first bite you could feel the hot sauce at the top and then it was gone throughout the entire kebab until at the end all the hot sauce was left with the salads at the bottom and after eating the last part my face was burnt ;) My friend's kebab was composed identically and his comment was identical :) . So despite the good quality ingredients, this fact meant that this kebab was not very good, just good. I hope that the next time we come, it will be evenly distributed and there will be a little more sauce and I will be able to give 5 stars! ;)",1710429809,True

Ribs - 8/10 - unfortunately not many places can make good BBQ, here they were close, but it was DEFINITELY too sweet. If you reduce the sweetness a bit and emphasize the flavor of the meat or add a little more patience or some spiciness, they may be delicious. The portion was also much larger than I expected.
Beef entrecote - 9/10 - I had a piece that had a little bit of fat in it (which is absolutely normal), but at this level of baking, the fat in these places was too soft and I simply don't like this texture.
Pancakes with sweet cheese - 10/10 - great cheese, perfect balance of taste. Well-chosen chocolate. The only thing it took away from me was fruit - although the fact that it was there pleasantly surprised me (literally, because I opened the box the wrong way and found it later ü§£)
