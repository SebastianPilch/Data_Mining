  'text': "This hotel is a welcome sight when staying in Warsaw. The rooms are big and comfortable. Rooms are air conditioned also. The shower is big and the water is hot. The breakfast is very good. Service is efficient.\n\nOne small complaint about the shower: there is no door, so the water gets out onto the floor of the bathroom. Also no shelf inside the shower itself so nowhere to put things.\n\nOverall this is the best hotel I've stayed at in Poland.",
